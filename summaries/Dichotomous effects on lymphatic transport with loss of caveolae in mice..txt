The study investigates the impact of caveolae loss, specifically through the deletion of caveolin-1 in mice, on lymphatic transport functions. Results show that while the initial uptake of fluids and macromolecules into lymphatic vessels increases, the overall transport function is impaired due to significantly reduced contractility of lymphatic collectors. The findings suggest that caveolae play crucial roles in regulating both lymphatic permeability and contractility, ultimately affecting lymphatic transport efficiency.
