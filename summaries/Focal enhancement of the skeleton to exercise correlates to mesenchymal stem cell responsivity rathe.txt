The study investigates how bones adapt to exercise by focusing on the responsivity of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) rather than merely external load magnitudes. While it was anticipated that bones exposed to higher peak forces during exercise would exhibit greater structural changes, findings revealed that skeletal enhancements were region-specific, with significant growth observed in the hindlimb bones (femur and tibia) despite lower loads compared to the forelimbs (humerus and radius) where responses were minimal. The results suggest that the differential response to exercise is better associated with the biological potential of MSCs in specific bone regions rather than just the mechanical forces exerted.
