The complete genome sequence of the Carnobacterium gilichinskyi strain WN1359T (DSM 27470T), isolated from Siberian permafrost, has been reported. This strain is notable for its ability to grow under conditions simulating the Martian atmosphere, including low temperatures and low pressure. The genome comprises 2,347,813 base pairs and includes five plasmids, with a significant portion of the genes annotated for various functions, furthering understanding of microbial life under extreme conditions.
