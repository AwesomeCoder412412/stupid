The study investigates how human presence affects the diversity of fungal species in an Inflatable Lunar/Mars Analog Habitat (ILMAH) designed to simulate conditions for future space missions. Over a 30-day human occupation, researchers observed significant changes in fungal community structure, with certain species increasing in abundance while others decreased, particularly noting a distinct change on day 20. The findings emphasize the importance of managing the mycobiome in enclosed habitats to prevent health risks to inhabitants and habitat degradation.
