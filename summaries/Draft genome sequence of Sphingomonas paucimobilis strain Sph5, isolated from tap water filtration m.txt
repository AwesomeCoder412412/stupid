The draft genome sequence of *Sphingomonas paucimobilis* strain Sph5, isolated from a tap water filtration membrane, has been reported, revealing its genetic profile critical for studying biofouling in water systems. Whole genome sequencing was performed, confirming the isolate's identity and highlighting its evolutionary relationship with other *Sphingomonas* species. This study aids in understanding the genetic traits associated with biofilm formation, which is essential for improving membrane filtration systems in drinking water treatment.
