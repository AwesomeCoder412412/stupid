The study investigates the mechanisms of cyanide resistance in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans using multiparameter behavioral analyses. It highlights that the resistance observed in egl-9 gene mutants is dependent on HIF-1 activation and is linked to the cysteine synthase gene cysl-2, which plays a role in detoxifying cyanide. The researchers developed a microfluidic device for high-resolution real-time imaging of worm behaviors in response to cyanide exposure, enhancing the understanding of the genetic basis of toxicant resistance.
