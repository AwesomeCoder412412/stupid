The study on avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) strain Ï‡7122 explores the characterization of its plasmids, revealing important genetic and phenotypic insights into the mechanisms of bacterial fitness and persistence. The findings highlight the roles of three large plasmids in iron transport, biofilm formation, and resilience against bile and acid stress, as well as a novel sugar utilization pathway that is not found in other E. coli strains but is present in Salmonella serovars. This research emphasizes the complexity of plasmid interactions and their significant impact on the virulence and adaptability of APEC in various environments.
