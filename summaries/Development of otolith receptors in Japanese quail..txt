The study focuses on the developmental morphology of otolith receptors in Japanese quail, detailing the growth of epithelial layers, hair cell density, stereocilia polarization, and afferent nerve innervation. Key findings include the exponential growth of otolith maculae during embryonic development, the sequential development of striolar and extrastriolar hair cells, and the establishment of topographic organization in afferent innervation patterns, primarily with calyx and dimorph afferents associated with type I hair cells and bouton afferents linked to type II hair cells. This research provides significant insights into the developmental biology of vestibular systems in avian species, contributing to a better understanding of sensory organ maturation.
