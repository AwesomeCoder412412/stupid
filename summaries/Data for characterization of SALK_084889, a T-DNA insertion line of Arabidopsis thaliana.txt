The study characterizes the T-DNA insertion line SALK_084889 of Arabidopsis thaliana, focusing on its insertion sites within the DREB2A and LOX1 genes. The research shows that DREB2A expression is not significantly downregulated under normal conditions but is affected during drought stress, while LOX1 is consistently downregulated across conditions. This data provides insights into the genetic mechanisms of drought and heat tolerance in Arabidopsis, contributing valuable information for further research on these genes.
