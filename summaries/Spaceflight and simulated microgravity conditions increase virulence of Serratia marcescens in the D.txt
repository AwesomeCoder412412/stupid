A study found that spaceflight and simulated microgravity conditions significantly increase the virulence of the pathogen Serratia marcescens when infecting Drosophila melanogaster. Bacteria grown aboard the International Space Station demonstrated higher lethality compared to ground-based samples, although this increased virulence was temporary and diminished when the bacteria were cultured back on Earth. The research indicates that the physiological changes in the bacteria due to space conditions may play a crucial role in their pathogenicity, independent of significant alterations in the host immune response.
