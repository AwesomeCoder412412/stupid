The study investigates multiple drug-resistant strains of *Enterobacter bugandensis* isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) and compares their genomics with human pathogenic strains. Findings reveal that the ISS strains exhibit significant genomic similarities with clinical strains and carry genes associated with antibiotic resistance and potential virulence, suggesting they could pose health risks for future space missions. Enhanced genomic profiling of these strains may inform further research on their pathogenic potential and the implications of microgravity on microbial behavior.
