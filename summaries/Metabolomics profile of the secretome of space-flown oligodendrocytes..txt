The study investigates the effects of space microgravity on the metabolomics profile of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), which are key cells for myelin formation in the central nervous system. Following a 26-day spaceflight on the International Space Station, OLPs exhibited increased levels of glutamate and energy metabolism, as well as enhanced mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis upon returning to Earth. These findings suggest that space conditions may significantly influence the metabolic state and potential maturation processes of OLPs, providing insights that could be valuable for addressing neurological issues during long-term space missions.
