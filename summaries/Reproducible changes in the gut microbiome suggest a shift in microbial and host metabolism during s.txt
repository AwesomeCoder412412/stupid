Research indicates that spaceflight leads to reproducible changes in the gut microbiome, affecting microbial and host metabolism. A study involving mouse fecal samples analyzed the gut microbial community aboard the International Space Station (ISS), revealing elevated microbial diversity and altered community structure associated with the spaceflight environment. The findings suggest that microgravity and other space-specific factors, rather than cosmic radiation alone, significantly influence gut microbiome composition and related metabolic capacities, potentially impacting astronaut health during long missions.
