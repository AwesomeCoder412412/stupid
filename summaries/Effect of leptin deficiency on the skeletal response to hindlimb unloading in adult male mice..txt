The study examines the effects of leptin deficiency on bone response in male ob/ob mice subjected to hindlimb unloading (HU), which mimics conditions of microgravity. Contrary to expectations, leptin deficiency did not lessen the bone loss associated with HU; both ob/ob and wild type mice showed similar magnitudes of osteopenia due to increased bone resorption during unloading. The findings suggest that leptin is not essential for skeletal response to mechanical unloading, although it plays an important role in normal bone growth and turnover.
