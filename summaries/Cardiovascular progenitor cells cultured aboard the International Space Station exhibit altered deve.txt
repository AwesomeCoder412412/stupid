Culturing cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) aboard the International Space Station has revealed alterations in their developmental and functional properties. Notably, neonatal CPCs exhibited increased expression of early developmental markers and enhanced proliferative potential, whereas adult CPCs showed limited changes in gene expression. These findings suggest that spaceflight may promote a more primitive, stem-like state in neonatal CPCs, presenting potential avenues for cardiac repair therapies and improving the understanding of cellular responses to microgravity conditions.
