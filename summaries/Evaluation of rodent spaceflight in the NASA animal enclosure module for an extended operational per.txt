The study evaluates the NASA Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) designed for rodent spaceflight to determine its capability to support rodents for an extended period of up to 35 days. Results indicate that the AEM successfully housed female C57BL/6 mice and male Sprague-Dawley rats, with the mice thriving with no significant health issues, while the rats required external food and water replenishment. This research demonstrates the AEM's flexibility for longer-duration missions, paving the way for future long-term studies on the International Space Station.
