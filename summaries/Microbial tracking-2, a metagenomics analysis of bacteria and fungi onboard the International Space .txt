The Microbial Tracking-2 (MT-2) study provides a comprehensive analysis of the surface microbiome aboard the International Space Station (ISS) over a 14-month period, focusing on the metagenomics of bacteria and fungi sampled from eight locations. The study found that the microbiome was dominated by human-associated microbes such as Staphylococcus and Malassezia, with temporal variations in microbial populations but no spatial differences. Additionally, the research identified a stable resistome, revealing the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes across various samples, which is crucial for maintaining astronaut health and spacecraft integrity during future space missions.
