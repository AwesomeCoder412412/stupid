The study investigates the effects of spaceflight on Drosophila fruit flies and their parasitoid wasps, revealing unexpected outcomes. While both species experienced changes in gene expression, particularly the activation of inflammation-related genes, the parasitoids showed resilience in their survival and virulence despite the space environment. Notably, tumor development increased in the flies with a chronic inflammation (CI) background, while control flies were more adversely affected by spaceflight conditions, suggesting that the impacts of microgravity may vary significantly based on genetic background and disease state. Additionally, unique mutant wasps with altered wing characteristics were identified post-flight, offering potential insights for future host-parasite interactions on Earth.
