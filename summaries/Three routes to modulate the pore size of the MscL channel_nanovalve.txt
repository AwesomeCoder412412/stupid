The research explores three methods to modulate the pore size and conductance of the MscL channel, a bacterial mechanosensitive channel used as a nanovalve in various nanotechnology applications. Findings demonstrate that shortening the linker between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, as well as cross-linking or employing heavy metal coordination, effectively reduces channel conductance in a reversible manner. These insights highlight the potential for engineering MscL channels to create versatile sensors and drug delivery devices with adjustable pore sizes, enhancing their applicability in nanotech implementations.
