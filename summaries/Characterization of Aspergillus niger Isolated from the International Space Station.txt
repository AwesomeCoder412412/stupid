A metabolomic analysis of *Aspergillus niger* isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) revealed significantly elevated production levels of the antioxidant pyranonigrin A, along with other secondary metabolites, compared to a laboratory strain. The findings suggest that genetic variations, including those affecting regulatory genes associated with secondary metabolite production, may contribute to this enhanced production in response to the unique stresses of the space environment. Additionally, pyranonigrin A's role in UV resistance indicates its potential significance for survival in high-radiation conditions faced by organisms in space.
