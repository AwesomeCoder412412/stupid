The study investigates how vortical flows in microfluidic models of venous valves affect the distribution of red blood cells (RBCs), which has implications for thrombosis formation. Using microscopy and computational fluid dynamics, the authors found that the interactions between fluid flows and RBCs led to non-uniform cell distributions drastically different from the bulk hematocrit, particularly at specific shear rates. The research highlights the need to consider local RBC concentrations in the context of venous thrombosis and provides insights for improving cell separation technologies in medical devices.
