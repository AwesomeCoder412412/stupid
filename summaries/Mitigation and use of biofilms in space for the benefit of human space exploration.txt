The article discusses the potential applications of microbes in sustainable space exploration beyond low Earth orbit, particularly for upcoming missions to the Moon and Mars. It emphasizes the dual nature of microbes, which can both benefit and hinder space missions; beneficial uses include aiding in bioregenerative life support systems and waste recycling, while challenges such as increased pathogenicity and biofilm formation pose threats to astronaut health and spacecraft integrity. Integrating microbiology research into mission planning will be essential for ensuring the success and sustainability of long-duration human space missions.
