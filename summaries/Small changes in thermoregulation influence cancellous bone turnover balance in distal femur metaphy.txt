A recent study examined how small changes in thermoregulation impact cancellous bone turnover in the distal femur of growing female mice. Mice housed individually at room temperature (22°C) experienced cold stress leading to significant cancellous bone loss, whereas those housed at a slightly warmer temperature (26°C) or group-housed at 22°C with nestlets showed reduced bone loss. The findings suggest that even modest adjustments in housing conditions can markedly influence experimental outcomes related to bone health.
