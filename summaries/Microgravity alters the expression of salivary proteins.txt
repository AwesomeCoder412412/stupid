The study assessed the impact of spaceflight on the morphology and biochemical behavior of the mouse submandibular gland, revealing no apparent morphological changes in female mice after 13-15 days in space. However, male mice flying for 30 days showed increased expression of certain proteins such as salivary androgen binding protein, epidermal growth factor, and nerve growth factor in their glands, indicating that both the duration of exposure to microgravity and the sex of the mice influence secretory protein expression. Overall, the findings suggest that salivary gland adaptations to spaceflight vary significantly among gland types and depend on various factors, making saliva a potential biofluid for monitoring astronaut health.
