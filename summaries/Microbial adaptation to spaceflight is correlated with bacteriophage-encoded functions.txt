Research from NASA's analysis of microbial populations on the International Space Station (ISS) reveals that bacteria are adapting to the space environment through the activity of bacteriophage-encoded functions. The study found significant differences in phage-associated genes between spaceflight strains and their Earth counterparts, with notable findings including 283 complete prophages, 21% of which are novel. The prophages are linked to traits that enhance bacterial survival in extreme environments, such as antimicrobial resistance and DNA damage repair, suggesting that bacteriophages play a crucial role in microbial adaptation to spaceflight, which may have implications for human health during long-duration space missions.
