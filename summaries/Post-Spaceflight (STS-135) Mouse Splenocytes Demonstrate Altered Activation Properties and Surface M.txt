The study examines the effects of a 13-day spaceflight (STS-135) on mouse splenocytes, revealing significant alterations in immune function, particularly in T-cell and dendritic cell populations. Post-spaceflight splenocytes showed unique surface molecule expression changes, indicating impaired immune responsiveness, while also demonstrating increased phagocytic activity. The findings highlight the need for understanding immune system alterations to mitigate health risks for astronauts on long-duration missions.
