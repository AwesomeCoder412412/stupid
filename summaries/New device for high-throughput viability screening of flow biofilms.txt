The article details the development of a new device, the BioFlux, which allows for high-throughput viability screening of flow biofilms. This microfluidic device facilitates the cultivation of multiple biofilms under controlled flow conditions, enabling rapid measurement of biofilm viability using fluorescent markers. It demonstrates effectiveness in testing the impact of antimicrobial agents on biofilms, which are known for their resistance to treatment, thus enhancing our ability to study and identify effective methods for controlling biofilm infections.
