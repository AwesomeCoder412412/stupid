The study investigates the genomic and functional characteristics of Enterococcus faecalis isolates obtained from the International Space Station (ISS), assessing their potential pathogenicity to astronaut health. Analysis of the isolates revealed that, despite higher predicted pathogenicity scores for these samples compared to certain clinical strains, no significant differences in virulence or environmental resilience were established. The findings suggest that while these ISS isolates possess some attributes of pathogenicity, they may largely resemble commensal strains and require further investigation into their actual impact on human health during space missions.
