Low-speed clinorotation in *Brachypodium distachyon* and *Arabidopsis thaliana* seedlings leads to root tip curvatures that resemble gravitropic responses, suggesting that the initial orientation during clinorotation can trigger directional growth behaviors. The study found that root curvature is influenced by the speed of rotation and is connected to mechanisms of gravity sensitivity, including the relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator and the formation of an auxin gradient across the root tip. Additionally, genetic variations among different accessions of *Brachypodium distachyon* indicate that some have a heightened ability to respond to clinorotation, providing a potential avenue for further research into the genetic basis of gravisensitivity.
