The corrigendum addresses an oversight in a previously published article regarding the transcriptional responses induced by high atomic weight, high-energy radiation (HZE). It corrects the accession number for the microarray dataset to GSE61484, confirming that all data has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus. The authors affirm that this correction does not impact the scientific conclusions of the original study.
