Recent transcriptomic studies have investigated how plants adapt to spaceflight and simulated microgravity environments. These analyses reveal common adaptive response pathways involving changes in gene expression related to cell wall remodeling, oxidative stress, defense mechanisms, and photosynthesis, important for plant survival in low-gravity and altered radiation conditions. The research highlights the role of specific environmental factors, such as light, in influencing growth and adaptation, and emphasizes the need for further studies to optimize plant cultivation for future long-term space missions.
