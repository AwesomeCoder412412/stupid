The research outlines the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles (GNPs) for rapid diagnosis and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. These GNPs enable a colorimetric change observable to the naked eye within five minutes, facilitating the detection of COVID-19 antigens at concentrations as low as 1 ng per mL, and viruses at 1000 virus particles per mL. Additionally, using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), the sensitivity is enhanced to detect antigens at 4 pg per mL and viruses at 18 particles per mL, while also demonstrating the capability to inhibit viral infection by blocking the virus from entering cells and disrupting its lipid membrane.
