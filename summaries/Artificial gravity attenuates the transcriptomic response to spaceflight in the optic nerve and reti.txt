The study investigates the impact of artificial gravity on the optic nerve and retina of mice during spaceflight, revealing that microgravity induces significant transcriptomic changes that correlate with oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death. Applying artificial gravity via centrifugation at varying levels (0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G) significantly mitigated these changes, particularly at 1 G, suggesting that increased gravitational forces can effectively protect ocular tissues from the harmful effects of microgravity. These findings underscore the potential for artificial gravity as a countermeasure to prevent spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome and support further research to optimize protective strategies for astronauts' ocular health.
