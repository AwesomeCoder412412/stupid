Research on Arabidopsis thaliana conducted in the NASA Biological Research in Canisters â€“ Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware aboard the International Space Station has revealed novel molecular mechanisms that enable plants to adapt to spaceflight environments characterized by microgravity and radiation. Integrative analyses of transcriptomics and proteomics show significant changes in the expression of genes and proteins related to photosynthesis, cellular transport, and stress responses, indicating that plants adjust their metabolic pathways and protein synthesis in response to the challenges of space. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of plant adaptability to extraterrestrial environments, which is vital for future space agriculture initiatives.
