The study describes the identification and characterization of HLB1 (Hypersensitive to Latrunculin B1), a plant-specific protein containing tetratricopeptide repeat domains, which plays a crucial role at the intersection of the exocytic and endocytic pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana. HLB1 associates with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and early endosomes, linking post-Golgi trafficking to actin dynamics and affecting protein recycling to the plasma membrane. Mutants lacking HLB1 show hypersensitivity to latrunculin B, defects in root hair development, and impaired cellular trafficking, suggesting specific functions in endomembrane logistics coordinated by the actin cytoskeleton.
