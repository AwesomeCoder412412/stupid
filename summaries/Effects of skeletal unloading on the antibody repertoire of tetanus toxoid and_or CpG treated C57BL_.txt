TAK-754 is an AAV8-based gene therapy vector designed to express coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) for treating hemophilia A. Preclinical studies showed that a single intravenous injection of TAK-754 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity and significant reductions in blood loss during hemostatic assays, while maintaining a good safety profile with minimal adverse effects and low integration rates in liver tissue. These promising results suggest that TAK-754 could serve as an effective therapeutic option for patients with hemophilia A, addressing the limitations seen in previous gene therapy approaches.
