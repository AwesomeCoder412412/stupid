The review discusses the application of various "omics" technologies to study the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in microgravity environments and highlights the profound biological impacts of spaceflight on its physiology. Key findings indicate substantial changes in metabolic and neuromuscular gene regulation in response to microgravity, supporting the notion that C. elegans can serve as an effective model organism for understanding the physiological adaptations to spaceflight. The integration of transcriptomic, proteomic, and emerging multi-omics approaches is suggested as the next frontier for uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptations, with potential implications for human health and space exploration.
