The study investigates the role of NADPH oxidase activity, specifically the respiratory burst oxidase homologs RBOHD and RBOHF, in managing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. It finds that these enzymes are essential for producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) during ER stress, which are crucial for adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling and help plants survive both temporary and chronic ER stress conditions. This work suggests a unique protective role for ROS in plants, contrasting with their detrimental effects observed in mammalian systems, and emphasizes the importance of RBOH activity in maintaining effective UPR during stress.
