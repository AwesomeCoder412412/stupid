This study investigates the combined effects of low-dose radiation (less than 1 Gy) and prolonged hindlimb unloading (HLU) on knee and hip joint cartilage in mice, simulating conditions faced by astronauts during spaceflight. The findings reveal that both low-dose radiation and reduced weight-bearing significantly contribute to cartilage degradation and the onset of an arthritic phenotype, as indicated by decreased cartilage volume, thickness, and collagen content, along with increased markers of cartilage catabolism. This research highlights the necessity for further exploration of protective strategies for joint health in long-duration space missions.
