Exposure of *Bacillus subtilis* to low pressure (5 kPa) significantly induces a variety of global regulons, notably the SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR), with a total of 363 altered gene transcripts identified during microarray analysis. The study highlights that 86 genes related to the GSR were upregulated, revealing the bacterium's response mechanisms to low-pressure stress, which may have implications for understanding microbial life in extreme environments such as Mars. Furthermore, while the GSR was activated under these conditions, the mutation of the sigB gene did not affect the bacterium's growth fitness at these low pressures, indicating that the GSR may not be essential for survival under such stress.
