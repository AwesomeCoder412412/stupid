The article provides a comprehensive comparison of various microgravity analogs, such as clinostats and random positioning machines, to actual spaceflight conditions in studies on plant growth and development. It highlights the evolutionary adaptations of plants to Earth's gravity and discusses how different methods simulate or alter gravitational effects to study plant responses. Although these analogs can offer insights, the results may vary significantly from those observed during spaceflight, underscoring the need for controlled experiments to enhance the comparability between ground-based and space experiments.
