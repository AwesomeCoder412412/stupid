This study investigates the effects of lifelong wheel running exercise and mild caloric restriction on apoptotic signaling in the aging plantaris muscle of rats. The research shows that both interventions significantly reduce nuclear levels of endonuclease G (EndoG), a mediator of caspase-independent apoptosis, while improving levels of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), which may provide protective effects against aging-related muscle loss. Overall, the findings suggest that engaging in regular exercise and mild caloric restriction can mitigate age-related muscle apoptosis and preserve muscle integrity through EndoG signaling and HSP regulation.
