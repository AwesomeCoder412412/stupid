The study investigates the reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in response to different types of radiation—gamma rays, protons, carbon ions, and iron ions—in a latently infected cell line. Findings reveal that all radiation types induce EBV lytic gene transcription, with gamma radiation being the most effective, while proton radiation also exhibited significant reactivation levels, particularly under lower doses. The research indicates that radiation can trigger viral reactivation independently of immune system changes, which is crucial for understanding health risks for astronauts exposed to cosmic radiation during space missions.
