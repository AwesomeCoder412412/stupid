The study investigates the effects of social isolation on tissue responses during prolonged simulated weightlessness using a hindlimb unloading (HU) model in mice. It found that while musculoskeletal deficits remained similar between singly and socially housed mice, social isolation influenced certain immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses. Specifically, social isolation exacerbated reductions in CD4+ T cells and altered adrenal gland mass, highlighting that social environment plays a significant role in biological responses to simulated weightlessness, which is relevant for understanding implications for spaceflight.
