The author correction addresses errors in affiliations for two contributors in the article "Multi-omics analysis of multiple missions to space reveal a theme of lipid dysregulation in mouse liver." The corrected affiliations clarify that Hossein Fazelinia is associated with the Protein and Proteomics Core Facility at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Deanne Taylor is linked to both The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. The corrections have been made in the article's PDF and HTML versions.
