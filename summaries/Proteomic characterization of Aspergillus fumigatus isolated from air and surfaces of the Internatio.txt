The study investigates the proteomic characteristics of *Aspergillus fumigatus* strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), highlighting the impact of the unique space environment (including microgravity and radiation) on the fungus. Analysis reveals that the space-isolated strains exhibit significant differences in their proteomes compared to clinical isolates, particularly with upregulated proteins related to stress response, carbohydrate metabolism, and secondary metabolism, indicating potential adaptation mechanisms for enhanced virulence. This research provides valuable insights into how *A. fumigatus* may pose risks to astronaut health during long-term space missions.
