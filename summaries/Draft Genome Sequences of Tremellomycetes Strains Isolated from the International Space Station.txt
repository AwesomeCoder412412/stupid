The draft genome sequences of six strains from the class Tremellomycetes, isolated from the International Space Station, were assembled to enhance the understanding of their potential pathogenicity under microgravity conditions. The study focuses on species such as Naganishia and Papiliotrema, which include both known human pathogens and lesser-known species that require further taxonomic study. This research contributes to the ongoing investigation of microbial life in space and its implications for human health and safety during long-duration space missions.
