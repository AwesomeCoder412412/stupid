The study on the Inspiration4 crew characterized immune responses to spaceflight using multi-omic analyses, revealing significant changes in cytokine levels and immune cell gene expression. Key findings include the identification of a "spaceflight signature" associated with increased oxidative phosphorylation and immune dysregulation, as well as notable differences in the immune responses between male and female astronauts. These results underline the importance of understanding immune system alterations in space to develop effective countermeasures for future space missions and ensure astronaut health.
