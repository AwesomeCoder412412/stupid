The study investigates the effects of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) in murine muscle and bone, highlighting GSK3 as a potential target to mitigate muscle and bone loss during space missions. It found that spaceflight reduced GSK3Î² content in the soleus muscle, leading to a shift in fiber composition, while inhibiting GSK3 before muscle unloading increased muscle mass and strength. Additionally, muscle-specific GSK3 knockdown linked to increased bone mineral density suggests a positive relationship between muscle health and bone maintenance, indicating that GSK3 inhibition could enhance musculoskeletal health in space.
