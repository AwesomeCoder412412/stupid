The study explores metabolic interactions within the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS), highlighting the role of *Klebsiella pneumoniae* and its relations with other microorganisms. Using computational models, researchers found that *K. pneumoniae* supports various microbes, particularly those from the *Pantoea* genus, while exhibiting detrimental interactions with fungi such as *Aspergillus fumigatus*, which were confirmed through experimental co-culturing. The findings underscore the complexity of microbial dependencies aboard the ISS and the potential implications for astronaut health and microbiome management.
