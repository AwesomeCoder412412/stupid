The MARSBOx project involved a balloon mission to the stratosphere that tested the survival of various fungal and bacterial samples in Mars-like conditions, such as extreme UV radiation and low pressure. Key findings included that the fungal spores of *Aspergillus niger* and the bacterium *Salinisphaera shabanensis* displayed significant resilience, while other strains showed varying levels of sensitivity to the harsh conditions. The results emphasize the potential for certain microorganisms to survive if inadvertently transported to Mars during space missions, underscoring the importance of these findings for planetary protection protocols.
