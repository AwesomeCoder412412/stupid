The study investigated sex-based differences in muscle response among Wistar rats subjected to hindlimb suspension (HLS) for 14 days, a model simulating microgravity conditions. Results indicated that female rats maintained muscle function better than males during disuse, exhibiting less reduction in grip strength and muscle mass. This research highlights the necessity for further examination of sex differences in muscle atrophy and responses to disuse, emphasizing the development of tailored countermeasures for both male and female astronauts in future space missions.
