The study explored the effects of high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) on the growth of *Brassica rapa* in microgravity during a space flight experiment. Results indicated that plants can perceive weightlessness and adjust their starch metabolism, particularly through amyloplast size modifications, enhancing their gravisensitivity. The research concluded that HGMFs effectively facilitate plant orientation in space without significantly altering gene transcription, suggesting a complex interplay between mechanostimulation and metabolic response to weightlessness.
