The study investigates the impact of mitochondrial dynamics and the overexpression of PGC-1α in fast muscle atrophy resulting from hindlimb unloading, a common model for muscle disuse. It was found that deactivated mitochondrial fusion processes and the activation of AMPK, which promotes catabolic pathways, play a significant role in the atrophy of fast muscle, such as the gastrocnemius. Interestingly, overexpressing PGC-1α in transgenic mice prevented muscle loss by maintaining the expression of pro-fusion proteins and inhibiting catabolic systems, suggesting that enhancing PGC-1α levels could be a potential strategy to treat muscle atrophy during periods of disuse.
