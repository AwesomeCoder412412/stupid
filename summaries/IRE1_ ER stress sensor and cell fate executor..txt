IRE1 is an essential endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor that regulates the unfolded protein response (UPR) to maintain cellular homeostasis. It can promote survival or lead to apoptosis through the controlled activation of different signaling pathways, including unconventional splicing and messenger RNA decay. The review highlights recent findings that demonstrate IRE1â€™s crucial role in cell fate determination during ER stress, emphasizing its conserved and divergent functions across plant and animal species.
