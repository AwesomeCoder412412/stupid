KatharoSeq is a high-throughput microbiome analysis protocol designed to effectively study low-biomass samples, capable of detecting microbial signals from as few as 50 to 500 cells. By integrating laboratory techniques and bioinformatics, KatharoSeq enhances the accuracy of microbial detection while minimizing contamination errors common in traditional methods, demonstrated through its application in diverse environments, such as spacecraft assembly facilities, neonatal intensive care units, and abalone-rearing facilities. The approach provides critical insights into microbial communities, showing distinct microbial profiles across different settings and emphasizing its potential in epidemiological and environmental studies.
