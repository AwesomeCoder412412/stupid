The study by Radtke et al. investigates the role of Salmonella's Type Three Secretion Systems (T3SSs) in the invasion and growth of this pathogen within a three-dimensional (3-D) model of human intestinal epithelial cells. Contrary to the traditional understanding that T3SSs, particularly SPI-1, are essential for Salmonella invasion, the findings indicate that Salmonella can invade these 3-D epithelial cells without relying on any known T3SSs, suggesting that alternative mechanisms may facilitate this process. Additionally, while the T3SSs are not required for invasion, they are necessary for effective intracellular replication, highlighting the complexity of Salmonella's pathogenicity in human gastrointestinal infections.
