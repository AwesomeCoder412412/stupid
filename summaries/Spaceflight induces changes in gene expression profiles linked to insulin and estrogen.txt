Research has shown that spaceflight induces significant changes in gene expression related to insulin and estrogen signaling in both rodents and humans. In animal studies, particularly in mice, alterations were most evident in the liver, which exhibited insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Similarly, in human astronauts, changes in genes associated with insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, and related metabolic pathways were observed, highlighting the need for further investigation into these effects to ensure the health of individuals venturing into space for extended periods.
