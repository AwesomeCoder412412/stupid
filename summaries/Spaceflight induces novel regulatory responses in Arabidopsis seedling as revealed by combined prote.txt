This study investigates the effects of microgravity on *Arabidopsis thaliana* seedlings through proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, revealing significant alterations in gene expression, protein abundance, and post-translational modifications. The analyses identified hundreds of differentially expressed mRNAs and proteins, with notable impacts on post-transcriptional regulation, cell wall synthesis, redox homeostasis, and plastid gene transcription. These findings suggest that spaceflight leads to unique regulatory adaptations in plants, providing insights for enhancing plant growth and efficiency in microgravity environments.
