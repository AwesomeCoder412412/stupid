The study investigates the effects of spaceflight on aging and frailty biomarkers in humans and rodents, revealing significant molecular changes that may parallel those seen in aging on Earth. Through analyses of data from NASAâ€™s GeneLab and recent space missions, researchers found altered gene expressions related to frailty and sarcopenia during spaceflight, suggesting that conditions akin to frailty may develop in astronauts as a response to the unique stressors of space. These findings highlight the potential for using a frailty index to monitor astronaut health and inform strategies for healthcare in space exploration.
