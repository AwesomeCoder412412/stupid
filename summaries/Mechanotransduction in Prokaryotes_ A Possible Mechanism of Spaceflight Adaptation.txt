This hypothesis paper reviews the mechanisms by which prokaryotic cells (bacteria and archaea) may sense and respond to microgravity in spaceflight, suggesting that they have analogous structures to eukaryotic mechanosensitive systems. It discusses evidence for mechanosensing and mechanotransduction in prokaryotes, exploring how mechanical signals could influence bacterial nucleoid architecture, DNA supercoiling, and gene expression. The authors propose a comprehensive model of prokaryotic mechanotransduction and highlight the importance of further experimental work in space to validate their hypothesis.
