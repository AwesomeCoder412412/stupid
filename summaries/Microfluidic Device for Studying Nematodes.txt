Researchers developed a size-separation technique using mesh filters to isolate Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, providing a more efficient and less harmful alternative to the traditional bleach synchronization method. This new filtration approach yielded approximately 9,500 embryos per plate compared to 5,000 using bleach, and it also produced healthier larvae without adverse effects on developmental outcomes. The protocol is scalable and can accommodate multiple strains, making it a valuable tool for high-throughput assays in genetics and developmental biology.
