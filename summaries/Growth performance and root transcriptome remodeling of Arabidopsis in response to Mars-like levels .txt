This study investigates the growth performance and root transcriptome of Arabidopsis under Mars-like magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) conditions. It finds that knockout mutants of specific magnesium and sulfate transporters do not significantly improve plant tolerance to high MgSO4 levels, with the cax1-1 mutant displaying partial tolerance, making it a subject of interest for developing plants suitable for Martian regolith. The research identifies over 300 differentially expressed genes after short exposure to MgSO4, revealing insights into plant stress responses and highlighting potential candidates for enhancing growth in similar environments.
