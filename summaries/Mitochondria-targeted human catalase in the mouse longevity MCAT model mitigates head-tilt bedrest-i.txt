The study investigates the effects of mitochondrial-targeted human catalase (MCAT) on neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of mice subjected to head-tilt bedrest, a model for microgravity. It was found that head-tilt bedrest increased microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in wild-type mice, while MCAT mice exhibited reduced neuroinflammation and associated behavioral changes. The research suggests that targeting reactive oxygen species (ROS) may help mitigate the cognitive and inflammatory consequences of spaceflight and similar sedentary conditions on Earth.
