The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) provides transparent access to data from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission, which offers extensive biological insights from civilian astronauts regarding the impact of space travel on human health. This collection includes omics and clinical assays, allowing for comprehensive research into space-induced biological responses and enabling multi-modal, longitudinal assessments. The OSDR aims to facilitate future research by establishing community-driven data standards, which are essential for utilizing advanced analytical techniques like artificial intelligence and machine learning to better understand the health implications of space travel.
