This research employed a causal inference machine learning ensemble, known as CRISP, to analyze the link between gene expression and liver dysfunction in mice that underwent spaceflight. Using transcriptomic and histological data, the study identified specific genes associated with a lipid density phenotype, which correlated with liver dysfunction akin to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This approach revealed potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms underlying spaceflight-induced liver issues, indicating a promising avenue for developing countermeasures for astronaut health in long-duration missions.
