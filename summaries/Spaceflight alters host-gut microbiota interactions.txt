A study published in NPJ Biofilms and Microbiomes explores how spaceflight impacts the interactions between hosts and gut microbiota by examining changes in mouse models after 29 and 56 days of exposure to microgravity on the International Space Station (ISS). Results indicated significant alterations in the gut microbiota composition, including a reduction in bacteria involved in bile acid and short-chain fatty acid metabolism, as well as changes in host gene expression related to metabolic pathways, immune responses, and extracellular matrix interactions. These findings suggest that disruptions at the host-gut microbiome interface during spaceflight may contribute to metabolic dysregulation and pose health risks for astronauts on long-duration missions.
