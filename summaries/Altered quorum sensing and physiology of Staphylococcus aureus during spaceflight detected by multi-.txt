The study investigates the effects of spaceflight on Staphylococcus aureus, analyzing data from the BRIC-23 experiment using RNA-Seq, proteomics, and metabolomics. It finds that during spaceflight, S. aureus exhibits increased quorum sensing and changes in metabolism, with upregulation of key virulence factors and genes related to urease activity and the type VII secretion system. These alterations suggest a potential increase in the bacterium's pathogenic potential in the space environment, raising concerns for astronaut health during long-term missions.
