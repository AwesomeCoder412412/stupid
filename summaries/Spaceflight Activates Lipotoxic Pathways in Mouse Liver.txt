Multi-omics analysis of liver samples from mice flown in multiple space missions revealed consistent lipid dysregulation tied to spaceflight conditions. Investigations highlighted abnormalities in lipid metabolism, characterized by increased lipid accumulation and activation of pathways linked to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Such alterations in liver function could potentially lead to health issues for astronauts during long-duration missions, meriting further study of the implications for human health in space environments.
