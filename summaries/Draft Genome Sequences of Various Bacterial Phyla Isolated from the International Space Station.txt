The study presents draft genome sequences from 96 bacterial strains, belonging to 14 different species, isolated from surfaces on the International Space Station (ISS) during the Microbial Tracking 2 study. These bacteria include common members of the human microbiome and several opportunistic pathogens, highlighting the importance of monitoring microbial diversity in space to ensure astronaut health. The genomic data is essential for understanding the potential spread and evolution of pathogenic organisms in the unique microgravity environment of the ISS.
