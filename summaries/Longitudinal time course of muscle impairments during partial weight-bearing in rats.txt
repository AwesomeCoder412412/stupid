The study examined the effects of partial weight-bearing (PWB) on rat muscle function and mass over a month, simulating conditions astronauts may encounter during extended space missions on the Moon and Mars. It found that muscle impairments, both in mass and function, began as early as seven days into reduced weight-bearing and continued to worsen over the month, highlighting the need for countermeasures to protect astronauts' health. The results suggest that even moderate reductions in mechanical loading can lead to significant muscle deterioration, emphasizing the importance of addressing muscle health for successful extraterrestrial exploration.
