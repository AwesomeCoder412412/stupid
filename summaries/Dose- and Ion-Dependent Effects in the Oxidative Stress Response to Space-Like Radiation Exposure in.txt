The study investigates the ion- and dose-dependent effects of space radiation on the oxidative stress response in the skeletal system, particularly focusing on osteoblastogenesis in mice. Exposure to high doses (200 cGy) of both high-LET (56Fe) and low-LET (protons) radiation resulted in significant bone loss and impaired osteoblast growth, with high-LET radiation showing a greater detrimental impact on bone-forming potential. The research highlights that while low radiation doses had minimal effects, high doses caused persistent oxidative stress and changes in gene expression related to redox states, contributing to long-term skeletal health risks for astronauts exposed to space radiation.
