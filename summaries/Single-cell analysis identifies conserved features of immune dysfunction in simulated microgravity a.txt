This study utilized single-cell analysis to investigate the effects of simulated microgravity on immune dysfunction, emphasizing its impact on gene expression in immune cells. The researchers found that exposure to microgravity altered critical immune pathways, including those related to interferon signaling and inflammatory responses, potentially linking these changes to increased susceptibility to infections and reactivation of latent viruses. Additionally, the study identifies quercetin as a compound capable of reversing some of these detrimental effects, opening avenues for potential countermeasures to maintain immune health during spaceflight.
