Research indicates that exposure to space microgravity significantly alters the behavior of neural stem cells (NSCs), leading to increased cell proliferation and abnormal division patterns, such as incomplete cell division (ICD) and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD). These changes raise concerns about potential long-term health implications for astronauts, particularly regarding neurological functions and susceptibility to cancers, as similar cellular abnormalities are often associated with tumorigenesis. The study emphasizes the need for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms, especially focusing on the secretome of NSCs in microgravity, which may play a significant role in these observed effects.
