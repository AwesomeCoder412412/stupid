Exposure to hypergravity during pregnancy and lactation in rat dams has been shown to disrupt their homeorhetic adaptations, leading to significant changes in circadian rhythms, metabolism, and reproductive behaviors. The study found that hypergravity resulted in decreased mammary metabolic activity, altered hormone levels, and reduced pup survival, largely attributed to the impact of gravitational forces on the dam's circadian system, which is crucial for coordinating metabolic and hormonal changes necessary for successful lactation. This research indicates that the environmental challenges of altered gravity can severely affect maternal health and offspring viability by impairing the physiological adaptations expected during the critical periods of pregnancy and lactation.
