A recent study indicates that spaceflight impairs antigen-specific tolerance induction and leads to heightened inflammatory responses in mice. The research demonstrated that mice exposed to space conditions exhibited a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokines and a reduced capacity for T-cell tolerance, potentially undermining immune function essential for long-term human space travel, such as missions to Mars. These findings suggest that spaceflight may disrupt the delicate balance of the immune system, leading to increased risks of autoimmunity and excessive inflammatory responses during prolonged missions.
