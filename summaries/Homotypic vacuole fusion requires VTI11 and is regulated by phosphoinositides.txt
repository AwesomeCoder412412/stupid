The study investigates the role of phosphoinositides in the localization and function of the HOPS complex subunits VPS41 and VPS33 during vacuole fusion in plants. It finds that VPS41 is necessary for vacuole fusion and is localized to the tonoplast, while VPS33 predominantly associates with late endosomes. Notably, the binding of these proteins to membrane structures is negatively influenced by certain phosphoinositides, which suggests a unique regulatory mechanism for vacuole dynamics in plants compared to other eukaryotes.
