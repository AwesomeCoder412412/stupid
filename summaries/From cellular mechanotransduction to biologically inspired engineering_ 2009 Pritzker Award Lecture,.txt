In his 2009 Pritzker Award lecture, Donald E. Ingber discusses over thirty years of research on cellular mechanotransduction and the tensegrity model of cell structure, asserting that cells operate as tensegrity systems. Ingber's work highlights the critical role of mechanical forces in cell function and tissue development, revealing how integrins serve as mechanoreceptors that link the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, mediating cellular responses to physical forces. This interdisciplinary approach has led to significant technological advancements, including new methods for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, informed by the principles observed in living systems.
