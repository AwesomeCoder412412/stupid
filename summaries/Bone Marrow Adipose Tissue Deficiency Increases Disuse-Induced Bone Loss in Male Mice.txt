A study investigated the effects of bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) deficiency on disuse-induced bone loss in male mice using a hindlimb unloading model. Contrary to the hypothesis that MAT deficiency would protect against bone loss, results showed that MAT-deficient mice experienced greater reductions in cancellous bone volume compared to wild-type mice, suggesting that the absence of MAT is linked to exaggerated bone loss during disuse. Histomorphometric analysis revealed that while MAT-deficient mice had increased bone formation and resorption, this imbalance ultimately led to a net loss of bone, indicating that MAT may actually play a protective role against disuse-induced bone loss.
