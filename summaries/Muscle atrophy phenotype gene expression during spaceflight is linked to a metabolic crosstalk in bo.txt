A study investigating muscle atrophy during spaceflight in mice revealed that gene expression related to muscle atrophy is closely linked to altered metabolic processes in both muscle and liver tissues. Key findings identified impaired lipid metabolism as significantly affected due to space exposure, leading to a downregulation of glucose transport and energy-demand processes in muscle, which correlated with muscle atrophy. These results suggest that metabolic stress and dietary adjustments may serve as potential countermeasures to mitigate the physiological challenges faced during long-duration space missions.
