This study investigates how radiation exposure and hindlimb unloading affect telomere length in murine skeletal muscle cells, using a model that simulates the conditions faced by astronauts during spaceflight. The results indicate that while radiation and unloading lead to telomere elongation in muscle stem cells and myonuclei, this lengthening does not revert to baseline after a recovery period of two weeks. The findings suggest potential involvement of alternative telomere lengthening mechanisms, particularly given that the classical telomerase activity was not observed, highlighting concerns for astronaut health regarding muscle atrophy and telomere dynamics during space missions.
