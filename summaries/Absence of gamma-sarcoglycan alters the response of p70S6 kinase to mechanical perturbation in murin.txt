The absence of γ-sarcoglycan alters the mechanotransduction pathway in murine skeletal muscle, specifically impacting the response of p70S6K to mechanical perturbation. In γ-sarcoglycan-null mice, although there is heightened basal phosphorylation of p70S6K independently of calcium, its activation during mechanical stretch is significantly prolonged, suggesting that γ-sarcoglycan plays a crucial role in the inactivation of this pathway. This study implies that disrupted load-sensing mechanisms may contribute to muscular dystrophies characterized by the deficiency of sarcoglycans.
