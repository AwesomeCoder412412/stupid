This study investigates the effects of simulated microgravity on gene regulation linked to immunity and cardiovascular disease using a rat hindlimb unloading model. The findings reveal sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage and gene expression, particularly in older male rats, suggesting potential risks in cardiovascular health due to altered immune and inflammatory responses during prolonged exposure to microgravity. The results highlight the necessity for developing countermeasures to mitigate these effects in future space missions.
