The study investigates the proteomic changes in **Arabidopsis thaliana** seedlings exposed to spaceflight on the International Space Station (ISS), identifying over 1,500 proteins in leaf and root samples. Comparative analysis revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins with significant differences in abundance, highlighting organ-specific responses to microgravity. The findings emphasize that spaceflight induces unique proteomic adaptations in plants, particularly in pathways related to cell wall remodeling and stress responses, which differ between leaves and roots.
