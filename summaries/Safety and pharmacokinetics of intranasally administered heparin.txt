This study investigates the safety and pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered unfractionated heparin (UFH) as a potential prophylactic for COVID-19. In mouse models, UFH showed no toxicity, with no significant changes in blood coagulation or adverse events, and a single-phase clearance from the nasal cavity was observed, retaining protective levels for up to 12 hours post-administration. In a small human trial, UFH was found to be well-tolerated with no systemic effects on coagulation metrics, supporting intranasal UFH as a promising candidate for viral infection prevention.
