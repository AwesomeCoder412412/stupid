The study focuses on the microbiomes of dust particles collected from the International Space Station (ISS) and cleanroom environments associated with spacecraft assembly, using various microbiological methods to characterize their viable microbial communities. Results indicate that the ISS microbiome is largely influenced by human-associated microorganisms, with a predominance of Actinobacteria, particularly Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium, unlike the cleaner environments of Earth-based facilities where Proteobacteria dominate. These findings underscore the unique microbial ecology of space habitats and emphasize the importance of enhanced monitoring and maintenance practices to ensure astronaut health and safety during long-duration missions.
