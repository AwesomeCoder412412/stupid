The study details the characterization of Aspergillus niger (strain JSC-093350089), isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), highlighting its unique traits compared to terrestrial strains, particularly ATCC 1015. Whole-genome sequencing and proteomic analyses showed that this ISS isolate exhibits increased growth rates, altered protein profiles involving stress responses, and enhanced melanin production, suggesting adaptations to extreme spaceflight conditions. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for addressing microbial challenges in closed environments during long-duration space missions, and may inform strategies to maintain crew health and habitat integrity.
