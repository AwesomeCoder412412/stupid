The study analyzes RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from rodent spaceflight experiments, revealing that sample collection methods significantly confound results, as preservation techniques can drastically affect gene expression profiles. It was found that differences in transcriptome data between tissues collected and preserved during spaceflight compared to those euthanized on Earth were primarily due to preservation methods rather than the effects of spaceflight itself. The study emphasizes the need for improved sample preservation protocols to avoid skewing data in future space biology research.
