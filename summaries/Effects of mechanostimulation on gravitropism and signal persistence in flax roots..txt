The study investigates how mechanostimulation affects the gravitropic response and memory in flax roots, using clinorotation to separate gravitational effects from mechanistic forces. Results show that while vertical clinorotation reduces growth and curvature in roots, horizontal clinorotation increases curvature. Notably, the gravity signal persists for about 2 hours, and 10 minutes of reorientation suffices to saturate the gravitropic response, indicating that mechanostimulation influences the strength but not the duration of the gravitropic memory.
