Prolonged exposure to particulate hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) has been shown to inhibit the nuclear import of RAD51C and BRCA2, essential proteins for homologous recombination repair, resulting in their accumulation in the cytoplasm. This mislocalization correlates with a decrease in RAD51 nuclear levels, which potentially contributes to Cr(VI)-induced chromosome instability and carcinogenesis. The study suggests that while RAD51C is more severely affected by Cr(VI) exposure than BRCA2, both proteins are crucial for proper DNA repair function, and their impaired nuclear import may play a significant role in the carcinogenic mechanisms of Cr(VI).
