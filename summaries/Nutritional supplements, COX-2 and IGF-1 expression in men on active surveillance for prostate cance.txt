The study investigated the effects of lycopene and fish oil supplements on gene expression related to prostate cancer in men undergoing active surveillance for low-burden prostate cancer. Conducted as a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial, the research found that neither lycopene nor fish oil significantly changed levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression compared to placebo after a three-month period. The results suggest that these nutritional supplements may not have the expected biological impact on the prostate microenvironment in this patient group, indicating a need for further research.
