This study investigates the impact of arogenate dehydratase (ADT) knock-out mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana through integrated multi-omics analyses, revealing that reduced ADT levels significantly affect lignin biosynthesis and various metabolic pathways, including protein, carbohydrate, and secondary metabolite pathways. The findings suggest novel regulatory mechanisms at the post-transcriptional and translational levels, indicating that ribosomal composition might influence lignin levels, potentially establishing a "ribocode" for lignin regulation. Ultimately, this research enhances understanding of lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and identifies new targets for plant bioengineering.
