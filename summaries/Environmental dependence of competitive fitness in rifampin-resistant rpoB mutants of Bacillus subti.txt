The study investigates how the competitive fitness of rifampin-resistant *rpoB* mutants of *Bacillus subtilis* varies in different environmental conditions. Using deep-sequencing and traditional growth measurements, researchers found that certain mutations in the *rpoB* gene can confer selective advantages in specific media, with notable shifts in dominance between wild-type and mutant strains based on the growth environment. The findings emphasize the complexity of microbial resistance, suggesting that adaptations leading to antibiotic resistance may not always carry a fitness cost in natural settings.
