The study investigates the role of secondary metabolites in providing UV-C protection and virulence in various strains of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, particularly focusing on melanin and other metabolites like fumiquinazoline. It was found that melanin's protective ability against UV-C radiation varies among strains, with some strains being more sensitive than others, and the virulence associated with melanin also differed. Additionally, fumiquinazoline was identified as a protective metabolite against UV-C, indicating that the contributions of secondary metabolites to environmental stress resilience and pathogenicity are strain-dependent and warrant further investigation, especially for implications in space exploration.
