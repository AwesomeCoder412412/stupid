This study investigated the morphology of biofilms formed by the fungus *Penicillium rubens* on various materials in microgravity aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The results indicated that microgravity did not significantly alter biofilm shapes, biomass, thickness, or surface area coverage, but it did affect biofilm formation variably depending on the material and incubation time; for instance, the Nanograss material consistently exhibited lower biofilm formation, suggesting its potential as a biofilm-resistant material. Overall, the findings highlight the complexities of biofilm dynamics in space and underscore the importance of material selection in spacecraft environments.
