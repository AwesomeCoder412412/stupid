The study investigates the combined effects of low-dose rate gamma (Î³) irradiation and simulated microgravity (via hindlimb unloading) on oxidative stress, DNA methylation, and tissue remodeling in the hearts of female mice over varying time points following a 21-day exposure. Results indicated a significant initial increase in oxidative stress and alterations in methylation potential, with the most pronounced effects observed shortly after exposure, but without long-term differences in indicators of cardiac remodeling or inflammation. Overall, while acute changes were recorded, the cardiac tissue appeared to recover over time, suggesting that further research is needed to fully understand the implications of these factors on heart health during space travel.
