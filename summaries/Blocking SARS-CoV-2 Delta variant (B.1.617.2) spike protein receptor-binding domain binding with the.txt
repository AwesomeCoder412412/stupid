The study discusses a novel approach using human host defense peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) to block the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of SARS-CoV-2 from entering host cells. The peptides HNP1 and LL-37, when conjugated to GQDs, effectively inhibited the virus by preventing its spike protein's receptor-binding domain from binding to the ACE2 receptor on host cells, demonstrating a binding affinity comparable to that of ACE2 itself. The findings suggest that this strategy could significantly enhance the effectiveness of current antiviral approaches against mutated variants of SARS-CoV-2.
