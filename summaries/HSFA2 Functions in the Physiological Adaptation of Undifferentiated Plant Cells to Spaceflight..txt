The study explores the role of Heat Shock Factor A2 (HsfA2) in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated plant cells of *Arabidopsis thaliana* during spaceflight, conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS). It was found that HsfA2 is crucial not only for responding to heat stress but also for specific adaptations to the microgravity environment, influencing cellular processes such as cell wall remodeling, signal transduction, and starch biosynthesis. The absence of HsfA2 led to a significant alteration in gene expression profiles needed for adaptation, highlighting HsfA2's role in managing endoplasmic reticulum stress responses and providing insight into the broader mechanisms of plant adaptation to extraterrestrial environments.
