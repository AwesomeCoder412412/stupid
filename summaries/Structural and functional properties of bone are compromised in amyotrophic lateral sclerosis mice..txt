The study investigates the impact of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) on bone structure and function in SOD1 G93A mice, revealing significant deficits in bone mass, microarchitecture, and mechanical properties compared to healthy controls. Specifically, ALS mice displayed reduced trabecular bone mass (54%), thinner trabeculae, and decreased cortical bone thickness, which contributed to lower bending stiffness and fracture toughness. These findings suggest that the skeletal fragility observed in ALS may be primarily a consequence of muscle atrophy and reduced mechanical loading, leading to a heightened risk of fractures in patients with advanced disease.
