This case report discusses a rare instance of meningitis caused by **Cryptococcus albidus**, a type of fungus associated with high mortality rates in central nervous system (CNS) infections. The patient, a severely obese female, was effectively treated with a combination of liposomal-amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, with the novel approach of calculating the medication dose based on her ideal body weight. The study highlights the need for proper dosing guidelines, particularly for obese patients, and reviews existing literature on CNS infections caused by **C. albidus** and related species, underlining the importance of identifying risk factors and treatment protocols.
