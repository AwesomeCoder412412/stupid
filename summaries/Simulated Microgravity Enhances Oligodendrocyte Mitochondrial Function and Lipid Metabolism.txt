The study investigates the effects of simulated microgravity (sim-μG) on oligodendrocytes (OLs), particularly focusing on their mitochondrial functionality and lipid metabolism. Findings show that sim-μG enhances mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in OLs, increases the secretion of various lipids, and suggests that OLs under microgravity conditions may be primed for myelination. These results indicate that sim-μG can beneficially influence OL metabolism, potentially leading to advancements in understanding brain health and strategies for treating myelin-related disorders.
