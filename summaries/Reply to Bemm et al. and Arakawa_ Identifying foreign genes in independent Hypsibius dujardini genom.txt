The authors respond to critiques regarding their findings of extensive horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the genome of the tardigrade *Hypsibius dujardini*, acknowledging an error in uploading an outdated genome assembly that contained significant microbial contamination, which may have influenced previous analyses. They report that independent assessments using different filtering methods confirm a notable presence of foreign genes in the genome, pointing to a potential biological role for HGT rather than it being solely a result of contamination. The authors outline the varying estimates of HGT due to differences in methodology and express confidence that further studies and technological advances will clarify the true extent of gene transfer in tardigrades.
