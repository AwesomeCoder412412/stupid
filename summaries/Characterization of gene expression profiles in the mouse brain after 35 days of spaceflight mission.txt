The study characterizes the gene expression profiles in the brains of male C57BL/6 mice after a 35-day spaceflight mission aboard the International Space Station. It found significant alterations in 54 differentially expressed genes related to neuroinflammation, neuronal function, and metabolism, showing downregulation of genes important for neuronal activity and oligodendrocyte function, suggesting a detrimental impact on neural health due to spaceflight conditions. The results indicate that spaceflight-induced stress responses may contribute to changes in immune function and brain metabolism, potentially leading to long-term neurological consequences.
