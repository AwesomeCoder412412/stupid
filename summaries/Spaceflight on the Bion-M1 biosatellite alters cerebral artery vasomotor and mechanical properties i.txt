The study investigates the effects of long-term spaceflight (30 days) on the functional, mechanical, and structural properties of cerebral arteries in mice aboard the Bion-M1 biosatellite. Findings show that spaceflight impairs both vasoconstriction and endothelium-dependent vasodilation of cerebral arteries, indicating a reduced capacity to regulate cerebral blood flow effectively in microgravity. Additionally, the results suggest that changes in arterial mechanics due to spaceflight do not correlate with alterations in extracellular matrix protein content, hinting that other environmental factors beyond microgravity may influence these vascular adaptations.
