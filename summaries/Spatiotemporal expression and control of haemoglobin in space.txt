This study investigates the expression and regulation of hemoglobin genes in astronauts during spaceflight, revealing significant down-regulation of globin gene expression correlated with the phenomenon of space anemia. Utilizing multi-omic datasets from NASA, JAXA, and SpaceX missions, the researchers observed a switch from adult to fetal globin gene expression during flight, which may serve as a protective mechanism against anemia. These findings enhance our understanding of erythropoiesis in microgravity and suggest potential therapeutic insights for managing anemia in space and on Earth.
