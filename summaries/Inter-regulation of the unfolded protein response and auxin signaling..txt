The article discusses the interrelationship between the unfolded protein response (UPR) and auxin signaling in plants, particularly in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. It highlights that ER stress adversely affects auxin signaling by down-regulating auxin receptors and transporters, while the UPR is crucial for maintaining auxin homeostasis and optimal physiological responses. The study identifies the role of IRE1, a key ER stress sensor, in modulating auxin responses and reveals the involvement of ER-localized auxin transporters such as PIN5 in UPR activation, suggesting a coordinated mechanism for regulating growth under stress conditions in plants.
