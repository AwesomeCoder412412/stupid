The study investigates the effects of common backpack loads on the lumbar spines of children with idiopathic low back pain (ILBP) using upright MRI techniques. It found that increasing backpack loads only compress the L5-S1 intervertebral disc in ILBP children, who experience less overall disc compression, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain compared to normal children. These findings suggest altered mechanisms for load tolerance in ILBP children, indicating a potential for heightened sensitivity to pain and suggesting that targeted physical therapy may alleviate symptoms associated with backpack loading.
