A reanalysis of the Mars500 experiment demonstrated significant alterations in the gut microbiome of astronauts after prolonged confinement of 520 days, revealing uniform decreases in beneficial bacterial species associated with anti-inflammatory effects and insulin sensitivity. Notably, key species such as *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii*, which is linked to gut health, were found to be depleted, aligning with observed metrics of inflammation and metabolic changes among the astronauts. Additionally, microbiota shared between the astronauts and their habitat were identified, highlighting the interconnectedness of human and environmental microbial communities in closed systems like those experienced during space missions.
