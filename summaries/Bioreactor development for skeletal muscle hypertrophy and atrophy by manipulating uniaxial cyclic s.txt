This study explores the development of a bioreactor to simulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy through the manipulation of uniaxial cyclic strain in C2C12 myotubes. The results demonstrated that applying cyclic stretch for 2 to 5 days induced hypertrophy, marked by increased myotube diameter and elevated anabolic signaling, while a subsequent cessation of stretch led to atrophy, indicated by reduced size and enhanced catabolic signaling. The findings indicate that the StrexCell bioreactor effectively mimics the effects of mechanical loading and unloading, providing a valuable tool for understanding muscle responses during spaceflight.
