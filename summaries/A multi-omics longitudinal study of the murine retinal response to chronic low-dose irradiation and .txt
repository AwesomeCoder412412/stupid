This multi-omics study investigated the effects of chronic low-dose radiation and simulated microgravity on mouse retinas over various time points (7 days, 1 month, and 4 months). Researchers found significant changes in methylation and gene expression profiles, identifying over 4,000 differentially methylated loci and nearly 500 differentially expressed genes, revealing disrupted biological processes related to retinal function and inflammation. The study underscores the importance of understanding the epigenomic and transcriptomic impacts of spaceflight hazards, which could inform future health management strategies for astronauts.
