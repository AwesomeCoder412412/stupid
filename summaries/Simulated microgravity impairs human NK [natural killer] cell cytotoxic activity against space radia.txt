Research demonstrated that simulated microgravity significantly impairs the cytotoxic activities of human natural killer (NK) cells against leukemic cells, particularly during conditions of continuous microgravity. Experiments showed that NK cells exposed to microgravity for 48 hours exhibited reduced ability to eliminate both K-562 (erythroleukemia) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells, with a pronounced decrease when the NK cells were continuously maintained in microgravity throughout the cytotoxicity assays. RNA sequencing revealed extensive alterations in gene expression linked to NK cell function, indicating the potential for increased cancer risk for astronauts from prolonged exposure to microgravity coupled with space radiation.
