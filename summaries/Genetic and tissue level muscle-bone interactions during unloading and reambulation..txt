The study investigates the interactions between muscle and bone during periods of unloading and subsequent reambulation in a genetically diverse population of mice. Results showed that muscle loss and bone loss occurred variably across individuals during unloading, and recovery rates during reambulation were also disparate. Importantly, there was no strong correlation between changes in muscle and bone morphology, and distinct genetic regulation of these responses suggests the traditional concept of a muscle-bone unit working in tandem may need to be re-evaluated.
