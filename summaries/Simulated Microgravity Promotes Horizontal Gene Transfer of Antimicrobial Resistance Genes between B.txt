A study conducted under simulated microgravity (SMG) conditions found that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes occurred more frequently between bacterial genera compared to normal gravity (1G) conditions, even in the absence of antibiotic selective pressure. Specifically, four strains of Staphylococcus aureus that were co-cultured with Acinetobacter pittii under SMG acquired significant resistance to oxacillin, highlighting a potential health risk for astronauts during long-duration space missions. This research suggests that the unique environment of space may enhance genetic exchange among bacteria, increasing the spread of antibiotic resistance.
