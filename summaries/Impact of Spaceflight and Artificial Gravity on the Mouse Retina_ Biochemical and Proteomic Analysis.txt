The study investigates the impact of spaceflight and artificial gravity (AG) on the mouse retina, particularly focusing on biochemical and proteomic changes. Results indicate that microgravity (Âµg) leads to significant apoptosis in retinal vascular endothelial cells and alterations in protein expression that may affect visual acuity and increase the risk of retinal degeneration. Conversely, the introduction of AG helps mitigate some of these harmful effects, suggesting that AG may be a beneficial countermeasure during space missions.
