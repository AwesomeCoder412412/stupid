The article discusses the phenomena occurring before earthquakes, particularly how animals may sense impending seismic events due to changes in electromagnetic emissions and other physical and chemical alterations in their environment. As tectonic stress builds up in the Earth's crust, positively charged electronic carriers, known as positive holes, are activated, generating electromagnetic signals that can ionize air and affect animal behavior. The insights suggest that these pre-earthquake phenomena and the physiological responses they elicit in living organisms are linked to the interplay of electromagnetic fields, air ionization, and chemical changes in water, which can lead to unusual behavior in various species leading up to an earthquake.
