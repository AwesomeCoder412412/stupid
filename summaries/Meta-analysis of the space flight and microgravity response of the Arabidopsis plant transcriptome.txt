This study conducts a meta-analysis of the transcriptomic responses of the Arabidopsis plant to microgravity and spaceflight by reanalyzing 15 experiments from NASAâ€™s GeneLab database. It employs standardized computational pipelines for data analysis to enhance comparability across different datasets and identifies key factors impacting plant responses, such as the type of transcriptomic assay and the environmental conditions during experiments. The findings reveal significant changes in gene expression related to environmental stress responses, secondary metabolism, and indicate potential markers for spaceflight responses, highlighting the importance of understanding how plants adapt to the unique challenges of space environments.
