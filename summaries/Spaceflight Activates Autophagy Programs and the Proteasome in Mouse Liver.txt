The study investigates the effects of spaceflight on mouse liver, highlighting significant changes in the activation of autophagy programs and the proteasome. Mice exposed to space for 13.5 days showed increased oxidative stress, reduced glutathione levels, and alterations in metabolic pathways, particularly those related to lipid metabolism and oxidative defense. The findings suggest that exposure to microgravity may impair liver function, leading to cellular senescence and steatosis, which has implications for astronaut health during long-duration space missions.
