This study investigates the relationship between ethylene-induced flavonol accumulation in guard cells and its effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and stomatal closure in Arabidopsis. The research reveals that flavonols, which accumulate specifically in guard cells in response to ethylene, act as antioxidants that suppress ROS levels, thereby moderating the rate of abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure. Elevating ethylene levels enhances the concentration of flavonols, reinforcing their role in reducing oxidative stress and contributing to plant responses to environmental changes.
