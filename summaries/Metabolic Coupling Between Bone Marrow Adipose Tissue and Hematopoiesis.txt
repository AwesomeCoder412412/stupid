The study investigates the role of the mannose receptor (Mrc1) in the bone marrow and immune system during diet-induced obesity using a mouse model. Mrc1-deficient mice showed impaired hematopoiesis, reduced levels of circulating inflammatory immune cells, and increased bone marrow adipocytes, resulting in improved metabolic profiles, including reduced weight gain, decreased liver steatosis, and enhanced glucose and insulin tolerance compared to wild-type mice. The findings suggest that Mrc1 deficiency contributes to a protective phenotype against obesity-related immune dysfunction by modulating the inflammatory response in metabolic tissues.
