Persistent activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) leads to telomere shortening independent of cell proliferation, which has significant implications for muscle regeneration, especially in conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Studies indicate that chronic NF-κB activation correlates with dysregulation of the Ku80 protein, resulting in increased DNA damage at telomeres and ultimately contributing to stem cell exhaustion and impaired muscle repair. These findings suggest that targeting NF-κB signaling might provide therapeutic avenues for enhancing MuSC function in degenerative muscle diseases characterized by chronic inflammation.
