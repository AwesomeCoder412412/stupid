This study introduces a Compact Imaging Platform (CIP) designed for conducting phenotypic assays of *C. elegans* on Earth and in space, featuring a compact, 3D-printed design that integrates a smart-device camera and requires no external optical components. The CIP is validated through various behavioral assays and demonstrates compatibility with different *C. elegans* substrates, achieving significant temperature control essential for the organism's assays. Its simplicity, low power requirements, and portability make it a valuable tool for research both in terrestrial settings and future space biology experiments on the International Space Station (ISS).
