The article outlines methods for expressing and characterizing mechanosensitive ion channels in Xenopus laevis oocytes, a popular system for studying membrane proteins. The authors highlight the advantages of using oocytes, such as low background ion channel activity and ease of handling, and provide detailed protocols for procedures including surgery for oocyte extraction, RNA preparation, injection, and patch-clamp electrophysiology to study the function of specific mechanosensitive channels like MscS and MSL10. These techniques enable the exploration of mechanotransduction in cellular processes, facilitating insights into the behavior of these channels under various experimental conditions.
