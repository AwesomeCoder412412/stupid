The research article discusses a yearlong study that examined the relationship between microbial communities and microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) in B20 biodiesel storage tanks. The study identified diverse bacterial populations and a prevalent filamentous fungus from the Trichocomaceae family, both associated with significant corrosion and biofouling. It concludes that fouling from microbial growth increases corrosion rates in biodiesel storage systems, emphasizing the need for effective management strategies to mitigate microbial contamination.
