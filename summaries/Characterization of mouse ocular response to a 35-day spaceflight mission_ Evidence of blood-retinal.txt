The study investigated the effects of a 35-day spaceflight on mouse ocular responses, revealing significant disruptions in the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and adaptations in retinal structure due to space conditions. Post-flight analysis indicated lower intraocular pressure (IOP) and increased apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells, suggesting compromised BRB integrity as evidenced by changes in specific protein expressions related to cell death and metabolic stress. These findings highlight potential risks for ocular health faced by astronauts during long-duration space missions and underscore the importance of understanding microgravity's impact on retinal physiology.
