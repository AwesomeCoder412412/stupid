The study conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis to identify potential therapeutic targets for chronic kidney disease (CKD) by examining druggable genes associated with the disease. From the analysis, 12 genes were found to have significant associations with CKD risk, particularly highlighting the TUBB gene, which showed strong evidence of sharing a causal variant with CKD. The findings suggest that TUBB could serve as a promising pharmacological target for CKD, offering insights for future drug development in this context.
