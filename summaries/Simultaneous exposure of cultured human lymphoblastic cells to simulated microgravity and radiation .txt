A study investigated the effects of simultaneous exposure to simulated microgravity (μG) and radiation on human lymphoblastic cells (TK6), revealing higher frequencies of chromosome aberrations (CAs) compared to exposure to radiation alone. The results indicated that the combined effects of μG and radiation (X-ray and carbon ion) lead to increased genomic instability, suggesting that astronauts may face greater health risks, including cancer, during long-term space missions than previously estimated. Importantly, the study highlights the necessity for understanding biological responses under these unique environmental conditions to properly assess and mitigate potential health risks for astronauts.
