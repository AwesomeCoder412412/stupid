The proteomic analysis of mouse brains subjected to spaceflight revealed significant alterations in the protein expression profiles of both gray and white matter after a 13-day mission aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Specifically, 26 proteins were identified to be significantly altered, contributing to changes associated with neuronal structure, metabolic function, synaptic plasticity, and oxidative stress response. These findings underscore the potential risks spaceflight poses to central nervous system integrity and emphasize the need for further research to understand the long-term implications on brain health during extended space missions.
