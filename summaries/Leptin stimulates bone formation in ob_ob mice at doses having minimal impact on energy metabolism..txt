The study examines the effects of leptin on bone formation in ob/ob mice, demonstrating that leptin infusion increases bone formation at lower doses than those required to influence energy metabolism. Specifically, significant bone growth and osteoblast activity were noted at leptin doses of 4-12 ng/h, while higher doses (40-80 ng/h) were necessary to impact metabolic indices. These findings suggest that peripheral actions of leptin on bone may be functionally distinct from its central effects on energy balance, with low circulating leptin levels sufficient to promote bone health without affecting energy metabolism significantly.
