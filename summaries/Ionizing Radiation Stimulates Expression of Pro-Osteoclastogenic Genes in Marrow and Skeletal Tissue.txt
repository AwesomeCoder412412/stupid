Exposure to ionizing radiation induces significant changes in bone resorption dynamics, specifically through the increased expression of pro-osteoclastogenic genes such as RANKL and other cytokines in both marrow and skeletal tissues. This study found that gamma and heavy-ion radiation led to a rapid rise in RANKL within 4 hours, with further peaks and sustained elevations in subsequent days, promoting osteoclastogenesis and increasing bone resorption markers. The results suggest that these molecular changes precede observed structural bone loss, highlighting a potential mechanism for radiation-induced bone deterioration that may be particularly relevant for astronauts during extended space missions.
