The study examines the effects of spaceflight on the morphology and biochemistry of the mouse submandibular gland, focusing on changes in secretory protein expression due to microgravity. Results indicated that male mice on a 30-day flight experienced increased levels of salivary androgen binding protein alpha, epidermal growth factor, and nerve growth factor, suggesting that prolonged exposure to microgravity significantly alters glandular function. In contrast, female mice showed no significant changes, indicating that responses to spaceflight may depend on factors such as sex and flight duration.
