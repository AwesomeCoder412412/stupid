NemaFlex is a novel microfluidics-based system developed for the standardized measurement of muscular strength in *Caenorhabditis elegans* (C. elegans), which enhances the ability to quantify muscle function in this genetic model. By employing pillar deflection to measure forces exerted by the nematodes as they navigate through an array of micropillars, the system ensures that strength assessments are independent of animal behavior and body size variation. The findings indicate that NemaFlex can reliably gauge maximum exertable force, facilitating research into muscle-related diseases and interventions by making this strength metric analogous to those used in human muscle physiology.
