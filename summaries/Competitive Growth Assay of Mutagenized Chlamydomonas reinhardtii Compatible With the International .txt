A study explored the competitive growth of mutagenized **Chlamydomonas reinhardtii** in breathable plastic tissue culture bags, suitable for the International Space Station's Veggie Plant Growth Chamber. By employing short-wave ultraviolet (UVC) mutagenesis, the researchers identified genetic mutations that enhance growth under space conditions, shedding light on the specific genes associated with DNA repair and metabolite transport. This research suggests significant potential for using microalgae like **C. reinhardtii** in space life support systems, emphasizing its viability as a food source and for other organic compounds essential for space missions.
