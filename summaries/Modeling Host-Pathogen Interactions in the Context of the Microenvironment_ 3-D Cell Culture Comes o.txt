The article discusses the evolution of three-dimensional (3-D) cell culture models for studying host-pathogen interactions and their importance in mimicking the complex microenvironments of tissues. Traditional two-dimensional (2-D) models fail to replicate the physiological conditions of the human body, limiting understanding of infection mechanisms and treatment responses. The review highlights various advanced 3-D models, including those using rotating wall vessel bioreactors and organ-on-a-chip technologies, that present a more accurate framework for investigating microbial pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies, suggesting these models are essential for future research and clinical applications in infectious diseases.
