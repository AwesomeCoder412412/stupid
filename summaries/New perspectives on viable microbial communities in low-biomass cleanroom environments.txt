The study investigates microbial communities in low-biomass cleanroom environments using advanced molecular techniques, including propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment combined with pyrosequencing and PhyloChip analyses. The findings reveal that a significantly higher diversity of viable bacteria exists in cleanrooms without spacecraft hardware compared to those with hardware, and that the majority of bacterial DNA detected in samples is from non-viable cells. This research highlights the effectiveness of using PMA to distinguish viable cells, emphasizing its importance for contamination control in sensitive environments such as those involved in spacecraft assembly.
