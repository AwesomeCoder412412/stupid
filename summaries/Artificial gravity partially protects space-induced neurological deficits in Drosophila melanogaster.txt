The study investigates the effects of microgravity (SFÎ¼g) and artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g) on the central nervous system (CNS) of *Drosophila melanogaster* during a 34-day mission aboard the International Space Station. It reveals that exposure to microgravity leads to significant behavioral and neurological deficits, including neuronal loss and oxidative stress, whereas artificial gravity partially mitigates these negative effects. The findings underscore the importance of understanding space-induced CNS changes as we prepare for future long-duration missions to Mars.
