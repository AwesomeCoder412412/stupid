The study investigated how the vestibular system of the land snail *Helix lucorum* adapts to a 30-day spaceflight and subsequently readapts upon return to Earth. It found that the absence of gravity led to plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system, demonstrated through altered geotactic behavior and gene expression in the statocyst. Postflight, the snails exhibited compensatory responses, adjusting their behavior to regain functional equilibrium roughly 20 hours after returning to normal gravity conditions.
