The study examines the transcription profiles of auxin-related genes during the positively gravitropic curvature of hypocotyls in Brassica rapa. It reveals that genes PIN1, PIN3, IAA5, and ARG1 show distinct transcription patterns in both the convex and concave flanks of the hypocotyl during curvature processes, with initial upregulation on the lower flank and downregulation on the upper flank. Over time, transcription profiles reverse as the hypocotyl approaches vertical orientation, indicating that the same genes are involved in both positive and negative gravitropic responses, suggesting a complex auxin-mediated mechanism governing hypocotyl curvature.
