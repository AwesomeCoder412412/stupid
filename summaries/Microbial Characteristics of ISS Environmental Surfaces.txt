This study examines the microbial populations in the potable water system aboard the International Space Station (ISS) through a longitudinal analysis of phenotypes, including antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, and metabolic adaptations. Using NASA-archived isolates from 2009 to 2015, researchers found notable variations in microbial behavior, suggesting adaptability and potential health risks for astronauts due to increased virulence and biofilm formation in microgravity. The findings highlight the importance of understanding microbial interactions over time, which have implications for both space health safety and water system management on Earth.
