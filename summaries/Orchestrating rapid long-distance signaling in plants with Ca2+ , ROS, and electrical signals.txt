Plants utilize a rapid systemic signaling network to respond to environmental stresses through the interaction of three key messengers: reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium ions (Ca²⁺), and electrical signals. This trio facilitates long-distance communication between cells, helping them prepare for threats like pathogens or abiotic stresses. The molecular mechanisms behind this signaling, including pathways through plasmodesmata and the role of specific proteins and ions, are still being investigated to fully understand how signals propagate swiftly and effectively across plant tissues.
