The study investigates the response of the plant *Arabidopsis thaliana* to varying gravity levels during spaceflight, specifically under blue light stimulation. Utilizing RNA sequencing, the research shows how different gravitational conditions affect gene expression, revealing that while microgravity led to significant changes in genes associated with light and photosynthesis, low gravity conditions (<0.1 g) induced a stress-related response with a higher number of differentially expressed genes. The findings suggest that the interplay of gravitropism and phototropism in space can alter plant growth responses, which could inform future efforts to develop biological life support systems for human exploration of the Solar System.
