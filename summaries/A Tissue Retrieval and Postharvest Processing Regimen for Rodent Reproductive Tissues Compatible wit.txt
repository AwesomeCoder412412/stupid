This article outlines a comprehensive tissue retrieval and processing regimen developed for rodent reproductive tissues, optimized for long-term storage compatibility with the International Space Station (ISS) and various postflight biospecimen sharing programs. The study establishes time-specific windows for optimal tissue harvest post-euthanasia to preserve histological integrity, RNA, and protein quality, with protocols indicating that tissue can be effectively stored in RNA later for up to 10 months at -80Â°C. The findings emphasize the importance of standardized harvesting methods, enabling enhanced data collection from multi-investigator programs in spaceflight research.
