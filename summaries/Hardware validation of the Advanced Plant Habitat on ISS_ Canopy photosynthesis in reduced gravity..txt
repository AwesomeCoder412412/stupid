The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) is a state-of-the-art plant growth facility aboard the International Space Station (ISS) designed for plant research in microgravity. A recent hardware validation test demonstrated its capability to control environmental conditions and grow both Arabidopsis and wheat in a closed-loop system for up to 135 days. The testing confirmed APH's effectiveness in measuring plant responses through parameters such as photosynthesis, respiration, and environmental control, laying the groundwork for future research in space agriculture and supporting long-term human colonization efforts.
