The article discusses the draft genome sequences of 28 strains of *Rhodotorula mucilaginosa* isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), highlighting its emergence as a human pathogen and its potential implications for space missions. This pigmented yeast, which can produce carotenoids, was identified for its ability to form biofilms and colonize life support systems, raising concerns about antimicrobial resistance in the unique conditions of space. The sequencing data allows for further investigation into the genes responsible for its biological activities and the development of countermeasures to address its presence in spacecraft environments.
