The study investigates the role of the gene Altered Response to Gravity 1 (ARG1) in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated Arabidopsis thaliana cells to the spaceflight environment. Through a comparison between wild-type (WT) cells and ARG1 knockout (KO) cells under microgravity, it was found that ARG1 plays a significant role in guiding gene expression changes necessary for adaptation, with 78 genes identified in WT and 130 in ARG1 KO as differentially expressed during adaptation. While ARG1 is not absolutely required for survival in space, it shapes the gene expression profile, suggesting that alternative pathways can compensate for its absence, thus emphasizing the complexity of genetic responses to spaceflight conditions.
