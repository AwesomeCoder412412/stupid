A study investigating the differences in fungal and bacterial communities in indoor dust from Earth-based homes and the International Space Station (ISS) found significant variations in microbial diversity. Earth-based dust samples were richer in diversity, containing 465 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) compared to only 102 in ISS dust. The research highlights how varying moisture conditions impact fungal growth, with ISS dust showing more rapid changes, primarily due to microbial stresses unique to the space environment, underscoring the importance of understanding indoor microbiomes in future spacecraft to ensure human health and safety.
