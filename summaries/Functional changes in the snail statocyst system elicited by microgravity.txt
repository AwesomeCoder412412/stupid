The study investigates the effects of microgravity on the statocyst system in terrestrial snails, specifically focusing on behavior, neural responses, and gene expression. After exposure to microgravity during two Foton missions, snails exhibited enhanced negative gravitaxis and increased sensitivity in their statocyst responses, along with upregulation of the Helix pedal peptide gene, which is involved in mechanosensation. These findings suggest that fundamental principles of gravi-sensing and adaptability to gravity changes may be conserved across different species, including vertebrates and invertebrates.
