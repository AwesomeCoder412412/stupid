The study investigates how varying angular frequencies during clinorotation affect the morphology and migration of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) under simulated microgravity conditions. Results indicate that increasing rotation speed led to more rounded cell shapes and reduced spreading area, with significant inhibition of cell migration and retraction noted at higher speeds (e.g., 75 rpm). The findings suggest that the angular frequency affects hMSCs' ability to sense gravity changes, influencing their morphological adaptation and motility, which may have implications for understanding stem cell behavior in microgravity environments.
