Research has shown that fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (PpFucCS) derived from the sea cucumber *Pentacta pygmaea* effectively inhibits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into cells, with its antiviral activity being strongly dependent on its molecular weight. High molecular weight PpFucCS demonstrated significant inhibition of HCMV by specifically blocking virus entry without causing cytotoxicity, unlike its lower molecular weight fractions which exhibited reduced antiviral efficacy. These findings suggest that PpFucCS could serve as a promising candidate for further development as an antiviral therapeutic against HCMV infections.
