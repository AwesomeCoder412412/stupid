The study examined the replication of Norwalk virus (NV) in a 3-dimensional (3-D) intestinal epithelial cell model (INT-407) but found no evidence of replication, as indicated by the lack of viral RNA increase or protein expression. While previous research had noted cytopathic effects (CPE) in similar models, the current findings suggest these effects were likely due to contamination with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) rather than active NV replication. Consequently, the 3-D INT-407 model is deemed inadequate for studying NV infections, emphasizing the need for improved in vitro systems that better mimic human intestinal responses to the virus.
