The study investigates the roles of two epigenomic regulators, Elongator Complex Subunit 2 (ELP2) and Methyltransferase 1 (MET1), in the spaceflight response of Arabidopsis thaliana. Results show that while both mutants exhibited altered growth and DNA methylation patterns in space, ELP2 was associated with poor root extension and significantly altered gene expression indicative of stress, whereas MET1 demonstrated better adaptation with milder effects on growth and gene expression. This suggests that differential epigenetic regulation significantly influences plant physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment.
