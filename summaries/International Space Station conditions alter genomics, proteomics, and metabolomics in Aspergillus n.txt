The study investigates the effects of the International Space Station (ISS) environment on the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, analyzing its genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Findings indicate that ISS conditions induced specific genomic mutations, altered protein expression involved in stress response and secondary metabolite production, and modified metabolic pathways, notably increasing the production of the secondary metabolite asperthecin while decreasing others. These results provide insights into the adaptive mechanisms of fungi in space, suggesting potential applications for biopharmaceutical production during long-duration space missions.
