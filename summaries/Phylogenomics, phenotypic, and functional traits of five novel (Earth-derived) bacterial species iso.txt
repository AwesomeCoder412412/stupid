This study identifies and characterizes five novel bacterial species, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), highlighting their unique phylogenomic, phenotypic, and functional traits. The species are categorized into four genera, displaying significant genetic differences from known relatives, as indicated by whole genome sequencing and various genetic analyses. The research provides vital insights into the microbial diversity aboard the ISS and emphasizes the potential implications of these novel species for human health, biotechnological applications, and understanding microbial behavior in extraterrestrial environments.
