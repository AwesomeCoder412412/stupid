The study investigates the cultivation of Staphylococcus epidermidis in the unique conditions of the human spaceflight environment, specifically aboard the International Space Station (ISS), and its effects on antibiotic resistance mutations. The results show that bacteria grown in space exhibited a significantly higher frequency of mutations leading to rifampicin resistance compared to ground controls, alongside an altered spectrum of mutations in the rpoB gene. This indicates that the spaceflight environment imposes distinct physiological stresses on bacteria, influencing their mutagenic potential and raising concerns regarding antibiotic resistance in long-duration space missions.
