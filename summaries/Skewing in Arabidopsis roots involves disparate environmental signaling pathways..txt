The study investigates the mechanisms underlying root skewing and waving in Arabidopsis thaliana, focusing on two ecotypes, Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia (Col-0), grown under tilted conditions. It identifies 11 candidate genes associated with skewing behavior, which are implicated in various cellular processes such as sugar transport, salt signaling, and hormone signaling. The research suggests that environmental signals drive the skewing behavior rather than physical restructuring, highlighting the complexity of root growth responses to different growth conditions.
