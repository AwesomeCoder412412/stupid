The study on Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats investigated the impact of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on bone and marrow blood flow, revealing significant changes in vascular control mechanisms associated with the disease's progression. While there were minimal alterations in vascular responses during pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic stages, long-term diabetes resulted in a marked decrease in endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation, along with enhanced vasoconstrictor responses, suggesting a shift towards a more constricted vascular phenotype. This vascular impairment correlates with reduced bone blood flow and may contribute to osteopenia observed in long bones of individuals with chronic T2DM.
