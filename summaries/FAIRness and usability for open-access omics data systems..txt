The assessment of NASA's GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) alongside four other open-access omics data systems measured their "FAIRness" using 14 metrics related to findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. The systems generally performed well in data findability and accessibility but struggled significantly with data interoperability, often lacking robust support for reusability of metadata. The analysis revealed an average FAIRness score of 10.1 out of 14, suggesting that while progress has been made in some areas, major challenges remain, particularly in implementing semantic interoperability and standardizing metadata practices across the systems evaluated.
