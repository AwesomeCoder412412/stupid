NASA is celebrating two significant milestones: the 30th anniversary of the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) and the 10th anniversary of GeneLab, both of which have been crucial in providing open access to space life sciences data. These data repositories, now unified under the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), facilitate the curation and accessibility of vital scientific information derived from various space missions, enhancing research collaborations and knowledge discovery in space biology. The OSDR integrates data from ALSDA and GeneLab to support ongoing scientific exploration and health in future space missions.
