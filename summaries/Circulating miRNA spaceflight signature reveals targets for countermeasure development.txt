The study identified and validated a specific microRNA (miRNA) signature that is shared between rodents and humans in response to simulated and actual spaceflight, highlighting potential biomarkers for countermeasure development against health risks associated with space travel. The research utilized samples from both rodents exposed to various spaceflight conditions and astronauts from NASA's Twins Study, confirming that certain miRNAs regulate vascular damage caused by simulated deep space radiation. Furthermore, the application of antagomirs to inhibit these miRNAs in human microvascular tissue constructs demonstrated an ability to mitigate the adverse effects of space radiation, suggesting a promising avenue for protecting astronaut health during future missions.
