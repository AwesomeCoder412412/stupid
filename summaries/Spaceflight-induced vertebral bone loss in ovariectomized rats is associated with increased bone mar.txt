A study on ovariectomized rats simulating spaceflight for 14 days revealed that spaceflight caused significant vertebral bone loss, characterized by a 32% reduction in cancellous bone area and a 306% increase in bone marrow adiposity without changes in bone formation rates. The increased adiposity was primarily driven by a rise in the number and size of adipocytes, while there was an associated increase in bone resorption, indicated by heightened osteoclast activity. The findings suggest that during spaceflight, mesenchymal stem cells may be preferentially directed towards fat cell formation instead of osteoblasts, contributing to the imbalance of bone turnover.
