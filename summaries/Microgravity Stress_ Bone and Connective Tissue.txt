The study investigates the effects of microgravity and lunar gravity on the skeletal and immune systems of mice during space travel, specifically focusing on changes in bone density, thymus weight, and gene expression. Findings show that while microgravity significantly reduces bone density and thymus size, lunar gravity (1/6g) partially mitigates these effects, with some organ-specific gene expression changes noted. Overall, the research underscores the complexity of biological responses to varying gravity levels, highlighting the need for further exploration to establish thresholds for maintaining health in future space missions.
