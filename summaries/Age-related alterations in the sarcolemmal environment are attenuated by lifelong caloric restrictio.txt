Lifelong caloric restriction (CR) and voluntary exercise (wheel running) significantly mitigate age-related alterations in skeletal muscle, particularly concerning the integrity of the sarcolemmal environment, which is crucial for muscle function. Research on Fischer-344 rats indicates that both interventions help maintain the expression of key proteins involved in muscle membrane integrity, repair, and signaling (e.g., dystrophin, Î±-syntrophin, nNOS) while reducing oxidative stress and damage associated with aging. Consequently, these findings suggest that lifelong CR and exercise could be effective strategies to prevent sarcopenia and promote enhanced muscle health as individuals age.
