The structure of the (+)-pinoresinol-forming dirigent protein (PsDRR206) was determined at 1.95 Ã… resolution, revealing a tightly packed trimeric design with three isolated active sites suitable for substrate binding. This finding suggests that the protein enables stereoselective coupling of monolignols to produce different pinoresinol enantiomers, as each active site is spatially separated to prevent intermolecular interactions. The study advances our understanding of the mechanisms behind lignan biosynthesis and provides insights into the functional similarities between dirigent proteins and allene oxide cyclases.
