This study investigates the skin microbiome of *Caenorhabditis elegans*, demonstrating that environmental microbes can enhance the cuticle's integrity, thus providing protection. Using a modified culturing technique, the researchers identified specific bacteria capable of adhering to the cuticle, which differ from gut-associated microbes. Overall, the findings suggest that these skin-resident microbes may play a crucial role in promoting host fitness and resilience against harmful environmental conditions.
