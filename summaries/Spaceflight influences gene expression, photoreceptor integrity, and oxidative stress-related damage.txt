A study investigated the effects of spaceflight on the murine retina, revealing significant changes in gene expression, photoreceptor integrity, and oxidative stress-related damage. Mice flown aboard the International Space Station for 35 days displayed 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), primarily linked to visual perception and retinal health, along with signs of cone photoreceptor degradation and increased oxidative stress. The findings suggest that extended spaceflight may adversely affect retinal performance and potentially lead to visual impairment, underscoring the need for further research into countermeasures for ocular health in space.
