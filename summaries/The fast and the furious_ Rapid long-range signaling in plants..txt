The article "The fast and the furious: rapid long-range signaling in plants" discusses the sophisticated systemic signaling mechanisms that enable plants to respond swiftly to local stimuli. It highlights the roles of various signaling molecules, such as RNAs, peptides, and hormones, as well as electrical, calcium, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals that propagate quickly throughout plant tissues. This multi-faceted signaling system allows rapid responses to environmental changes, such as herbivory, enhancing the plant's ability to defend and adapt.
