The study investigates the role of the ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 (OCT1) in Arabidopsis thaliana's root length responses to cadaverine, a polyamine. It finds that natural variations in OCT1 expression contribute to differing sensitivities to cadaverine among various accessions, with higher OCT1 expression correlating with increased resistance. Through genetic analysis, it is identified as a major quantitative trait locus influencing root development in response to this organic cation.
