The study explores the use of Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Fixation Tubes (KFTs) for conducting human-tended plant biology experiments during suborbital spaceflights. The KFTs were found to effectively carry and fix plant samples at different stages of simulated flight, showcasing the consistent transcriptomic responses of plants to changing gravitational conditions. Results indicated that while the plants maintained health and displayed expected gene expression alterations in response to hypoxia and clinorotation, the method enables researchers to perform practical experiments in the unique suborbital environment, providing insights into plant biology in microgravity.
