The study investigates the effects of hindlimb unloading (HU) on the vasomotor properties of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA) in rats, a model for the physiological changes associated with spaceflight or prolonged inactivity. It was found that HU did not enhance vasoconstrictor responses of the PNA but significantly reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilation, impairing blood flow to bone and marrow without altering passive mechanical properties. These changes are linked to decreased nitric oxide signaling, suggesting that the elevation in vascular resistance and diminished perfusion during skeletal unloading is primarily due to impaired vasodilatory function rather than increased vasoconstriction.
