The study investigates how the conditions of spaceflight affect the behavior and genetic expression of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Findings show that spaceflight enhances cell aggregation and promotes random budding, suggesting potential changes related to virulence, as over 450 genes were differentially regulated under these conditions, including those related to stress and antifungal resistance. Despite these changes, no increased virulence was observed in a murine infection model, indicating that further research is necessary to fully understand the implications of microgravity on fungal pathogenicity.
