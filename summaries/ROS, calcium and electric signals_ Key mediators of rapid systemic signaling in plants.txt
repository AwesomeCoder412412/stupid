The study investigates the role of vascular bundles in mediating systemic reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in Arabidopsis plants exposed to light stress. It highlights the importance of the RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG D (RBOHD) protein, showing that its expression specifically in phloem or xylem parenchyma cells can restore both local and systemic ROS responses and systemic acquired acclimation (SAA). The findings suggest that the integration of ROS and other signaling mechanisms occurs at vascular bundles, making them central to the plant's systemic response to environmental stress.
