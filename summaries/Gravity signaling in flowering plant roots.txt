Research on a rice mutant referred to as CRW1 reveals that mechanosensing inhibits ethylene signaling, thus promoting proper root gravitropism. This study indicates that overaccumulation of ethylene response factors OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 leads to impaired reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and auxin distribution, ultimately causing root coiling in hydroponic conditions. However, when grown in soil, these effects are mitigated due to the mechanical resistance encountered, indicating a significant interplay between ethylene signaling, mechanosensing, and ROS in regulating rice root growth.
