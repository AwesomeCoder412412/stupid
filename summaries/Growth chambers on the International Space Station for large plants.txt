The study investigates the quality difference of bread wheat kernels grown in space aboard the International Space Station (ISS) compared to those grown on Earth. It finds that while the wheat kernels from space exhibit slightly smaller weight and dimensional differences, the overall symmetry and major parameters of the kernels do not significantly differ. Additionally, the study reveals that kernels from space contain a lower proportion of type B starch granules, which may affect their baking quality, alongside a notable reduction in the aleurone layer's cell width, indicating potential impacts on nutritional content due to space growth conditions.
