The article discusses the challenges and considerations for implementing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) in spaceflight, emphasizing their significance for understanding gene expression in various biological systems in a microgravity environment. Although advances in these techniques have been rapid on Earth, their application in space has yet to catch up due to issues with tissue preservation, data analysis complexities, and the unique conditions of space that can affect experimental outcomes. Recommendations for improving methodology include optimizing tissue collection and preservation protocols, developing automated workflows for molecular biology experiments aboard spacecraft, and creating standardized analysis pipelines to handle the generated data effectively.
