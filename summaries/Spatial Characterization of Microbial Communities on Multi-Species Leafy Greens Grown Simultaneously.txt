The study investigates the microbial communities present on multi-species leafy greens grown on the International Space Station (ISS) using the Veggie system. It finds that the microbial diversity is higher in the roots and rooting substrates than in the leaves, with microbial safety confirmed through pathogen screening. The work suggests that understanding these microbial communities is crucial for ensuring food safety and optimizing plant growth in the unique conditions of space.
