The study investigates the differences in arteriolar function and blood flow regulation in intra-abdominal adipose tissue (AT) due to aging and exercise. It finds that older rats exhibit increased AT blood flow during exercise, contrasting with a decrease seen in younger rats, which is attributed to diminished vasoconstrictor responses in old age. However, chronic exercise training appears to normalize these responses, enhancing the vasoconstriction of AT arteries and allowing for better regulation of blood flow during physical activity, indicating potential avenues for improving exercise capacity in older adults.
