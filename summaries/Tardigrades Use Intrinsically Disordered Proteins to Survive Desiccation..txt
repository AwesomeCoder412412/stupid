Tardigrade secretory-abundant heat soluble (SAHS) proteins have been shown to protect biological structures, such as liposomes and desiccated bacteria, from damage due to dehydration. Research demonstrated that these proteins undergo structural transitions under desiccation, enabling them to stabilize cellular components effectively and enhance the survival of microbes like *E. coli* and *Rhizobium tropici* during drying. The findings indicate potential applications for SAHS proteins in preserving biological materials, especially in agricultural contexts.
