The NASA GeneLab RNA-seq consensus pipeline is a standardized framework designed to process short-read RNA-sequencing data from experiments involving spaceflight. This pipeline incorporates several steps including quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed genes. The objective of the pipeline is to enhance data accessibility, promote reproducibility, and facilitate cross-analysis of data relevant to the space environment, with processed outputs available publicly through the GeneLab database.
