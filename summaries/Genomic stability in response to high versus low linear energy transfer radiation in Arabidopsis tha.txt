The study investigates the genomic stability of *Arabidopsis thaliana* in response to high LET (linear energy transfer) HZE particles versus low LET gamma radiation. The results indicate that HZE particles are approximately three times more effective at inducing biological damage and genomic instability compared to gamma rays, as evidenced by root growth inhibition and increased rates of loss of heterozygosity in treated plants. The findings highlight the significant role of DNA repair mechanisms, particularly those governed by ATR and ATM kinases, in maintaining genomic stability under different types of radiation exposure.
