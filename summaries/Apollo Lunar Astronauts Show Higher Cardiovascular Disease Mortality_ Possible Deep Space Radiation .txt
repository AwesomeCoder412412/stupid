A study comparing mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) among astronauts revealed that Apollo lunar astronauts exhibit significantly higher rates of CVD mortality (43%) compared to non-flight (9%) and low Earth orbit (LEO) astronauts (11%). This suggests that the exposure to deep space radiation may negatively impact vascular health, potentially through damage to endothelial cells. The findings underscore the need to address the health risks of prolonged space missions beyond Earth's protective magnetosphere, especially as plans for future manned missions to Mars and the Moon develop.
