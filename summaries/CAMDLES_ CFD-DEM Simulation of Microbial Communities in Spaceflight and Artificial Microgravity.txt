The study introduces CAMDLES, a computational framework that models microbial community dynamics in artificial and space microgravity using CFD-DEM (Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method). It specifically examines how fluid dynamics and spatial distribution affect metabolite exchange and growth rates between two bacteria species, *Escherichia coli* and *Salmonella enterica*, in rotating wall vessel bioreactors. The results indicate that spatial organization and aggregation play crucial roles in microbial growth, with CAMDLES contributing valuable insights for future experiments in microgravity and for the design of biological research tools.
