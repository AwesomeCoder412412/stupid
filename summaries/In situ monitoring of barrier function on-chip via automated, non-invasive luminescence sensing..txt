The study presents a novel fiber optic-based sensing platform designed for automated, non-invasive monitoring of barrier function in organs-on-a-chip (OOCs). This technology allows real-time tracking of epithelial and endothelial barrier integrity during cytokine-induced inflammation, showing high sensitivity and the ability to operate continuously over extended periods. The platform significantly improves upon traditional methods by providing automated data collection without direct interaction with the cell culture, thus avoiding issues like electrode fouling.
