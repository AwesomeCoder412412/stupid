Research has shown that human neural stem cells (NSCs) can proliferate and generate young neurons while in space, demonstrating an increased metabolic state characterized by higher oxygen consumption and glycolysis compared to ground control cells. After being exposed to microgravity for 39.3 days aboard the International Space Station, the NSCs retained their ability to differentiate into neurons and exhibited immature electrophysiological properties. These findings suggest that understanding the behavior of NSCs in space can help develop countermeasures for health risks associated with long-duration space missions and may offer insights for potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases on Earth.
