The study conducts genomic characterization on two isolates of *Fusarium oxysporum* (designated ISS-F3 and ISS-F4) collected from the International Space Station, uncovering their distinct genomic features compared to terrestrial strains. While these isolates possess potential virulence traits, particularly ISS-F4, which proved more virulent in a *Caenorhabditis elegans* model, they appear unlikely to act as plant pathogens due to a limited number of effector genes. This research highlights the isolates' relevance for biotechnology and health implications, given their unique genomic makeup and secondary metabolite production pathways, which may hold significance for human health in space environments.
