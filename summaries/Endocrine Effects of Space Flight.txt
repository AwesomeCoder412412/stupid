The study examined the effects of simulated microgravity using a 3D clinostat on the central nervous system of mice, revealing significant behavioral, metabolic, microbiomic, and transcriptomic changes. Mice exposed to clinostat treatment exhibited decreased activity and alterations in gait, alongside enhanced fear memory and changes in brain gene expression related to immune and endocrine responses. The findings suggest that this model effectively mimics some aspects of the physiological changes experienced during actual spaceflight, highlighting its potential for further exploration of microgravity's impact on neurological health.
