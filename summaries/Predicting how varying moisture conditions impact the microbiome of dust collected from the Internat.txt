A study investigating the effect of varying moisture conditions on the microbiome of dust collected from the International Space Station (ISS) demonstrated that even short periods of elevated relative humidity significantly enhance microbial growth, particularly of fungi. Using the time-of-wetness framework, researchers found that fungal concentrations increased dramatically with relative humidity, while bacterial community composition also shifted under constant moisture conditions but could not be modeled accurately. These findings underscore the importance of understanding microbial dynamics in space environments to ensure astronaut health and spacecraft integrity as human activity in space expands.
