The unfolded protein response (UPR) is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis in plants by enhancing the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during environmental stress. It operates through specific signaling pathways, notably involving master regulators such as IRE1 and bZIP60, to manage protein folding and prevent cytotoxic accumulation of misfolded proteins, thereby playing significant roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. Understanding UPR mechanisms is essential for improving crop resilience and yield amidst various challenges, as highlighted by recent studies that explore the integration of UPR signaling with other cellular processes and stress responses.
