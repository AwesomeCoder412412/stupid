This review discusses advances in genome mining related to the secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by various species of *Aspergillus*, covering the years 2012 to 2018. It highlights significant progress in identifying and characterizing SM biosynthetic gene clusters, elucidating their pathways, and activating cryptic gene clusters, which are crucial for discovering new drug candidates and optimizing the production of existing bioactive compounds. Furthermore, it emphasizes the potential of different genetic engineering strategies to enhance the yield and create novel derivatives of these valuable natural products.
