The study investigates the effects of microgravity on pelvic bone loss in mice, revealing significant decreases in bone volume and thickness due to increased osteoclastic activity and potential osteocytic osteolysis. Exposed to microgravity, the mice experienced a notable rise in osteoclast numbers and cell cycle inhibition in osteoblastic cells, indicated by elevated levels of CDKN1a/p21. The findings highlight the complex mechanisms behind bone degradation during spaceflight, indicating that both osteoclastic resorption and disruptions in cellular processes contribute to rapid bone loss in a microgravity environment.
