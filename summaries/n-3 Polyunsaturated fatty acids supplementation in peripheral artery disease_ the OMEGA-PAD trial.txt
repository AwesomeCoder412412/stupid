The OMEGA-PAD II trial investigated the effects of three months of high-dose omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation on patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The results showed that while supplementation significantly increased the omega-3 index and levels of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) in the fish oil group, there were no significant changes in systemic inflammation markers or functional outcomes, such as walking ability. The findings suggest potential benefits of omega-3 PUFA on vascular health in PAD patients, highlighting the need for larger studies to confirm these outcomes.
