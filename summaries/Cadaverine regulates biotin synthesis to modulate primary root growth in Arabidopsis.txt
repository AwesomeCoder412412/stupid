Cadaverine, a polyamine, influences primary root growth in *Arabidopsis thaliana* by regulating biotin synthesis through inhibition of the BIO3-BIO1 enzyme responsible for biotin production. A genetic mutation identified as cadaverine hypersensitive 3 (cdh3) displayed increased sensitivity to cadaverine, leading to reduced biotin levels and consequently lower fatty acid synthesis due to diminished biotinylation of key proteins. This research highlights cadaverine's role in modulating plant growth in response to environmental factors by altering metabolic pathways related to biotin and lipid biosynthesis.
