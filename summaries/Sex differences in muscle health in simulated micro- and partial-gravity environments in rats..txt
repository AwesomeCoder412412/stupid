This study investigates sex differences in muscle health among rats exposed to simulated microgravity and partial-gravity environments. It finds that female rats experience greater muscle atrophy and strength loss compared to males in both gravity conditions, regardless of sex steroid hormone presence. These findings suggest that female astronauts may require additional interventions to mitigate musculoskeletal losses during space missions, highlighting the need for sex-specific strategies in addressing muscle health in microgravity.
