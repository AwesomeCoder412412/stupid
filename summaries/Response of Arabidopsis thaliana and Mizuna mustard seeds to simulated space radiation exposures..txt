The study investigates the effects of simulated space radiation on the seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Mizuna mustard, focusing on how these seeds respond to galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE). Findings suggest that the type of radiation, its dose, and the water content of the seeds influence germination and seedling development; specifically, hydrated seeds were more sensitive to radiation damage than dry seeds. Additionally, while some irradiated seeds showed reduced growth and deformation, the findings indicate that the response varies significantly between species, highlighting the need for targeted research on crops suitable for space missions.
