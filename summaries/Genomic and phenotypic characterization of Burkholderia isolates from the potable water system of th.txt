This study explores the microbial diversity and characteristics from two flex lines of the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Microbial analyses revealed the presence of various bacterial species, notably *Burkholderia* and *Paraburkholderia*, associated with distinct biofilm formations and resistance to environmental stresses, including high chromium levels. The findings suggest that the UPA flex lines represent unique ecological niches within the ISS water recovery system, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring and strategies to manage biofilm growth in future space missions.
