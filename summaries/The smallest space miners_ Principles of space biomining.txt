The article discusses the concept of space biomining as a strategy for resource utilization in extraterrestrial environments, like the Moon and Mars, to support human settlements. It emphasizes the potential of using microbial techniques to extract essential materials such as metals, water, and nutrients from regolith and rocks, while acknowledging the challenges posed by different environmental conditions in space compared to Earth. The research highlights the need for tailored microbial systems and biotechnologies to overcome these challenges and enhance in-situ resource utilization for sustainable space exploration.
