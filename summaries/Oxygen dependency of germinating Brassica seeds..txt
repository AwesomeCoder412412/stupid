The study investigates the impact of various seed priming techniques—hydropriming, halopriming, and osmopriming—on the physio-biochemical responses of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) under salinity stress (100 mM NaCl). Results indicate that salinity significantly reduces seed germination and seedling growth, while priming treatments enhance germination indices, seedling vigor, and physiological attributes such as proline content and photosynthetic pigments, ultimately mitigating oxidative damage. The findings suggest that different priming methods can effectively improve tolerance to salinity, making them useful strategies for enhancing crop production in salt-affected environments.
