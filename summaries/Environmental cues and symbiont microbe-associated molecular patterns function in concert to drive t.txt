The research on the symbiosis between the squid Euprymna scolopes and the bacterium Vibrio fischeri reveals that the daily remodeling of the crypt-cell brush border in the light organ is driven by both environmental cues and microbial signals. Specifically, the effacement and repolarization of microvilli occur in a rhythmic pattern triggered by dawn light cues and are influenced by the presence of symbionts. The study highlights that while the effacement of microvilli does not require symbiont colonization, the subsequent increase in microvillar density is induced by symbiont-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), underscoring the complex interplay between the hostâ€™s circadian rhythms and its microbial partners in
