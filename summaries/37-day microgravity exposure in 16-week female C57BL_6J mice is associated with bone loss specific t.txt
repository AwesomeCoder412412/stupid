A study examining the effects of 37 days of microgravity on 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice found that bone loss was specifically localized to weight-bearing skeletal sites, notably the femur, while the spine remained largely unaffected. The researchers used microcomputed tomography and histological analyses to determine significant decreases in bone volume and other metrics in weight-bearing regions, suggesting that mechanical unloading in a microgravity environment is the primary cause of bone loss, as opposed to systemic factors like space radiation. Additionally, the study observed an accelerated process of secondary endochondral ossification in the femoral head, possibly indicating premature skeletal maturation in microgravity conditions.
