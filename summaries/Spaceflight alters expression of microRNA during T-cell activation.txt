Research conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) revealed that spaceflight significantly alters microRNA (miRNA) expression during T-cell activation, specifically showing that miR-21 is up-regulated under normal gravity conditions but suppressed in microgravity. This study found that microgravity leads to a global suppression of 85 immune-related genes, which suggests that the immune response is negatively affected in space. The findings indicate that gravity plays a crucial role in regulating T-cell activation through mechanisms involving both gene transcription and miRNA-mediated translation repression, highlighting potential implications for long-term space missions and astronauts' health.
