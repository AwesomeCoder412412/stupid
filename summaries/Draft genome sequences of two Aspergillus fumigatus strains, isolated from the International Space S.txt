The draft genome sequences of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), were published to facilitate the study of their virulence characteristics compared to clinical strains. These strains exhibited increased lethality and resistance to UV254 radiation in a larval zebrafish model, indicating their potentially enhanced pathogenicity under microgravity conditions. This research aims to understand the molecular mechanisms behind their virulence and suggests that countermeasures may be necessary for astronaut health during long-duration space missions.
