The study investigates the role of mechanosensing in rice root gravitropism, revealing that mechanosensing antagonizes ethylene signaling to promote proper root growth. A mutant rice strain, identified as **COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1)**, showcases impaired gravitropism due to overaccumulation of ethylene signaling factors (OsEIL1 and OsEIL2), leading to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and root cap instability. By applying gentle mechanical resistance, such as in water-saturated soil, the study demonstrates that Ca²⁺ signaling mitigates ethylene overactivity, restoring root gravitropism through regulation of ROS and auxin distribution.
