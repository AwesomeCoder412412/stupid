Research shows that wild mouse gut microbiota enhances resistance to initial tuberculosis (TB) infection in BALB/c mice by improving early immune responses. In a study comparing conventional BALB/c mice (LabC) to those reconstituted with wild mouse microbiota (WildR), results indicated that WildR mice managed lower lung bacterial loads during the early stages of TB infection despite similar histopathological outcomes and overall immune responses later on. The findings underscore the importance of gut microbiota diversity in influencing disease resistance and highlight potential implications for TB treatment strategies.
