A randomized controlled trial assessed the effects of various concentrations of epinephrine mixed with physiological saline (1:5000, 1:10,000, 1:20,000, and 1:40,000) administered subcutaneously in the external auditory canal during otoendoscopic surgery. The study found that while surgical field clarity was similar across all concentrations, higher concentrations significantly impacted hemodynamic parameters compared to lower concentrations. The authors concluded that concentrations of 1:20,000 to 1:40,000 are preferable to minimize hemodynamic changes while still providing adequate surgical field clarity.
