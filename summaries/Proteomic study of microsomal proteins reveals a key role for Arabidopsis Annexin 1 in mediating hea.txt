A proteomic study focusing on the microsomal proteins in Arabidopsis revealed that Annexin 1 (AtANN1) plays a crucial role in the plant's response to heat stress by mediating the increase in intracellular calcium levels. The study identified that AtANN1 is rapidly upregulated following heat shock, and loss-of-function mutants for AtANN1 and its close homolog, AtANN2, displayed increased sensitivity to heat stress, while overexpressing AtANN1 resulted in enhanced thermotolerance. The findings suggest that AtANN1 is integral to the calcium signaling pathway necessary for the plantâ€™s adaptive response to elevated temperatures, which may involve collaboration with other signaling proteins.
