The study focused on characterizing metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from environmental samples collected on the International Space Station (ISS), revealing significant microbial diversity and evolutionary adaptations due to microgravity conditions. A total of 46 MAGs were assembled, identifying 18 bacterial species, including two novel species, and for the first time, four fungal genomes from ISS samples. The research highlighted ISS-specific evolution in microbes, particularly in antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, suggesting that prolonged exposure to microgravity may influence microbial behavior and adaptability.
