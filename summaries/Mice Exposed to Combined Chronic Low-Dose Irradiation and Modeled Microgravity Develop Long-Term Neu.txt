A study published in the *International Journal of Molecular Sciences* investigated the long-term neurological effects on mice exposed to combined chronic low-dose gamma-ray irradiation and simulated microgravity through hindlimb unloading (HLU). The findings indicated that while single exposures (LDR or HLU) resulted in minimal changes to gene expression and methylation, the combination of both led to significant alterations in pathways related to neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, suggesting potential long-term neurological sequelae. This research highlights the complex interaction between radiation and microgravity on brain health and underscores the need for further studies to understand the implications for astronauts on long-duration space missions.
