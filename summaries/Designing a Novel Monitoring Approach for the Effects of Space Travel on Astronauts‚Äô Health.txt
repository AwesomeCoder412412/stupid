The study investigates the health impacts of space travel on astronauts by analyzing gene expression changes using a dataset from ten astronauts during their missions. It identifies 218 differentially expressed genes, highlighting that space travel affects genome regulation and correlates with an increased risk of various health issues, including cancers. The researchers propose a novel rapid assay using 32 key genes to monitor astronaut health in space, advocating for further validation in microgravity conditions to enhance its effectiveness before practical application.
