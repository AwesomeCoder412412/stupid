Phosphoinositides regulate the localization of the HOPS subunit VPS41, which works alongside VPS33 in mediating vacuole fusion in plants. The study illustrates that while both VPS41 and VPS33 participate in vacuole dynamics, VPS41 is uniquely positioned at the tonoplast, and its tonoplast localization is dependent on phosphoinositides. The findings reveal significant differences in the mechanisms of HOPS recruitment and function in plants compared to other eukaryotic organisms, especially highlighting a non-conserved mechanism of phosphoinositide regulation on HOPS assembly.
