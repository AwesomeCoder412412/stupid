The study investigates the transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to spaceflight conditions, highlighting the role of the Hfq protein as a global regulator. The bacterium exhibited differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with significant changes in virulence-related genes such as lecA, lecB, and rhlA, indicating potential alterations in pathogenicity under microgravity. The research emphasizes the impact of the space environment on bacterial behavior and its implications for infectious disease risk during space missions, while also drawing parallels with microbial responses observed in low-shear simulated microgravity conditions.
