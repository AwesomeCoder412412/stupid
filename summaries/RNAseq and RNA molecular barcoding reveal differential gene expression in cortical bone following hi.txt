The study examines how hindlimb unloading (HLU) affects gene expression in the cortical bone of female mice, revealing significant changes in mRNA transcript levels through RNA sequencing and molecular barcoding techniques. After a week of HLU, transcripts related to Wnt signaling and metabolic processes were altered, including increased levels of Pfkfb3 and Mss51, suggesting their roles in the boneâ€™s adaptive response to mechanical loading changes. The findings highlight the potential for identifying novel mechanosensitive genes that could serve as targets for preventing disuse-induced osteoporosis.
