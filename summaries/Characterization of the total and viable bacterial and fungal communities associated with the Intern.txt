The study conducted a comprehensive characterization of bacterial and fungal communities on the surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS) across three flight missions over 14 months, utilizing both culture and molecular methods. Findings revealed diverse microbial populations that varied over time but were consistent across different locations, with a significant proportion of the microbes identified being associated with the human microbiome, including potential opportunistic pathogens. The results highlight the importance of understanding microbial communities in closed environments like the ISS, providing baseline data vital for future long-term human space missions and implications for similar confined environments on Earth.
