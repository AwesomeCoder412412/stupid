The study investigates the role of osteocyte apoptosis in triggering the production of RANKL (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-ÎºB Ligand) and subsequent bone resorption in mice subjected to hindlimb unloading (HLU), a model for disuse. It finds that HLU significantly increases osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL expression, resulting in cortical and trabecular bone loss, and that preventing apoptosis with a caspase inhibitor completely halts both RANKL production and bone resorption. These findings suggest that osteocyte apoptosis is a critical mechanism that regulates bone remodeling in response to mechanical disuse conditions.
