A study investigated the susceptibility of *Bacillus subtilis* cells to various antibiotics after cultivation in microgravity aboard the International Space Station compared to ground control conditions. The results indicated minimal differences; out of 72 compounds tested, only nine showed significant differences in resistance, with only slight increases or decreases in susceptibility. Importantly, the study concluded that space flight does not significantly enhance antibiotic resistance in *B. subtilis*, suggesting little concern for increased resistance during human space missions.
