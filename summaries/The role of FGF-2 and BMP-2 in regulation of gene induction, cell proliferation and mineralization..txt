The study examines the roles of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) in bone healing, specifically how they influence gene expression, cell proliferation, and mineralization. FGF-2 significantly promotes cell proliferation while downregulating genes associated with mineralization, whereas BMP-2 effectively stimulates mineralization-related gene expression without notably affecting growth-related genes. These findings suggest that FGF-2 is critical for the early stages of fracture repair, while BMP-2 is essential for later mineralization, indicating a need for both factors at different stages of bone healing.
