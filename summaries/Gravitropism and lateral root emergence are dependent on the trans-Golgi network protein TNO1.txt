The study investigates the role of the trans-Golgi network protein TNO1 in auxin-mediated processes like gravitropism and lateral root emergence in Arabidopsis thaliana. It was found that the absence of TNO1 leads to defects in auxin transport, delaying lateral root emergence and gravitropic bending. These defects are linked to reduced auxin asymmetry and impaired transport mechanisms, suggesting that TNO1 is crucial for proper auxin responses during plant development.
