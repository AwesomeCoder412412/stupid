The study examines how age and exercise training affect the phenotype and function of coronary microvascular smooth muscle in rats. It finds that aging impairs contractile responses in coronary arterioles and shifts smooth muscle towards a secretory, non-contractile phenotype, contributing to reduced coronary blood flow. However, late-life exercise training can restore contractile function and revert the smooth muscle phenotype back to a more youthful state, partially due to improved adiponectin signaling.
