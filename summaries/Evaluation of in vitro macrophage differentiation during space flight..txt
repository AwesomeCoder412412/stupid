The study evaluated how space flight affects the differentiation of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages by examining changes in receptor expression and gene transcripts during a 14-day flight on the Space Shuttle STS-126. The results indicated that macrophages proliferated significantly more in space compared to controls on Earth, although there were notable changes in the expression of specific surface markers, suggesting a unique differentiation environment in space rather than just a simple accelerative process. Overall, space flight appeared to influence hematopoiesis and potentially impact immune responses through alterations in gene expression related to macrophage function.
