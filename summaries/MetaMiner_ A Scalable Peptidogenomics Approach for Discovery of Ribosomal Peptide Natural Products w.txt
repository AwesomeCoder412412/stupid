MetaMiner is a novel software tool developed for the discovery of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) from diverse microbial communities. Unlike existing methods, MetaMiner can efficiently analyze large genomic and mass spectrometry datasets, including those with unknown post-translational modifications, to identify both known and unknown RiPPs. Following extensive testing across various environments, MetaMiner successfully discovered 31 known and 7 unique RiPPs, showcasing its potential to enhance natural product discovery and antimicrobial drug development.
