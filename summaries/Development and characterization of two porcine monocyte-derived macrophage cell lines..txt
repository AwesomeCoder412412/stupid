The study screened a library of 297 natural anti-inflammatory compounds for potential antiviral effects against African swine fever virus (ASFV), which poses a significant threat to pig production. Five promising compounds, particularly tetrandrine and berbamine, were identified for their ability to inhibit ASFV-induced cytopathic effects and reduce viral replication in vitro. The research indicates that these compounds not only demonstrate antiviral activity by disrupting ASFV entry into host cells but also significantly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting their potential as dual-action therapeutic agents against ASFV.
