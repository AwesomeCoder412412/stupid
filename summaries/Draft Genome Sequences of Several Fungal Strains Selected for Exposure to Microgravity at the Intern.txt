The study presents the draft genome sequences of eight fungal strains selected for exposure to microgravity at the International Space Station (ISS). These fungi, isolated from environments related to the Chernobyl disaster, are of interest due to their potential to produce novel bioactive compounds and exhibit unique metabolic pathways. The sequenced genomes will facilitate further research into their applications in biotechnology and natural product discovery.
