This study investigates the effects of immunization on mouse heart inflammation during spaceflight by analyzing mice that were immunized with tetanus toxoid and CpG adjuvant aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The findings reveal that such immunization activates the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, leading to increased heart inflammation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This research highlights the unique cardiovascular responses to immune challenges in space and sets the stage for further exploration of cardiac health in astronauts.
