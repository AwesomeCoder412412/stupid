The research explores how modeled microgravity affects the production of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Findings indicate that exposure to microgravity-like conditions increases LPS shedding and OMV production, which is associated with stress on bacterial cell membranes, impacting microbial physiology. This study suggests that such alterations could have implications for host health, particularly during space missions, highlighting the need for understanding microbiome dynamics in reduced gravity environments.
