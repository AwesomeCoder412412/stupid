The study analyzes the long-term impacts of space radiation on the cardiovascular system by using data from NASA's GeneLab database. It identifies the gene FYN as a central hub that is activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to space radiation, suggesting that FYN plays a protective role by reducing ROS levels that could damage the cardiovascular system. The findings indicate potential risks associated with space radiation for astronauts and highlight the need for further research to develop effective countermeasures.
