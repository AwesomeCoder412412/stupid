Research on the growth of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in lunar regolith samples from Apollo missions reveals that while the plants can germinate and grow, they exhibit significant stress responses and slow development, indicating that lunar regolith is not a benign growth medium. Transcriptomic analyses show differential gene expression related to stress from ionic, metal, and reactive oxygen species, suggesting that additional research is needed to better understand these interactions and optimize the use of lunar regolith for plant growth in future lunar habitats. Consequently, while lunar regolith has potential for supporting plant life, it poses substantial challenges that need to be addressed for effective use in long-duration lunar exploration.
