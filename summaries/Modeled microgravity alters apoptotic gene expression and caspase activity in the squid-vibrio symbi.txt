The study investigates the effects of modeled microgravity on the apoptotic gene expression and caspase activity within the squid-bacteria symbiosis, specifically between the Hawaiian bobtail squid (*Euprymna scolopes*) and the bioluminescent bacterium *Vibrio fischeri*. Under microgravity conditions, researchers found that apoptosis-related genes were expressed earlier and at higher levels, particularly those related to caspases, whose activity also increased significantly. These findings indicate that microgravity alters apoptosis dynamics, potentially impacting the health of animal-microbe interactions during spaceflight; importantly, it suggests that the adverse effects of these changes could be mitigated with pharmacological inhibitors.
