The study analyzed the effects of single fraction whole chest radiation on the cortical thinning and structural changes of bone in rhesus macaques. Findings revealed that significant decreases in cortical thickness and bone mineral density occurred predominantly in vertebrae exposed to radiation, especially in younger animals, indicating greater sensitivity to radiation effects. The results highlight the rapid deterioration of bone structure post-irradiation and suggest implications for managing bone health in patients undergoing radiation therapy.
