A study investigated the effects of a diet supplemented with dried plum powder (DP) on preventing bone loss in mice subjected to simulated spaceflight conditions, which include microgravity and radiation exposure. The DP diet demonstrated effectiveness in mitigating the negative impacts on bone microarchitecture and mechanical properties caused by hindlimb unloading and radiation, protecting osteoprogenitor cells from impairments. These findings suggest that dietary supplementation with dried plum could serve as an effective countermeasure against skeletal deficits encountered by astronauts during long-duration space missions.
