The study assessed airborne microbial patterns across the troposphere by conducting metagenomic measurements of bioaerosols collected from NASA's C-20A aircraft over the Sierra Nevada mountains at altitudes between 10,000 to 40,000 feet. Results revealed significant changes in microbial composition and diversity correlated to altitude, with genera such as Mycobacterium and Achromobacter prevalent at lower altitudes, while Alcaligenes and Penicillium dominated higher up. Additionally, the study developed a predictive model for bioaerosol dispersal, providing insights into the potential impacts and dynamics of atmospheric microbiomes on public health and agriculture.
