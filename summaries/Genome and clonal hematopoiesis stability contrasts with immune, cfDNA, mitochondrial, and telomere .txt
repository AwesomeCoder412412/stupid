The study analyzed the physiological impacts of the Inspiration4 (I4) short-duration spaceflight mission using a multi-omic approach, focusing on genome stability, immune responses, telomere lengths, and clonal hematopoiesis. Results indicated that while telomeres elongated during the flight and shortened after returning to Earth, no significant clonal hematopoiesis changes or whole-genome instability were observed, suggesting genomic stability across the crew over a three-month period. Immune adaptations were noted, including increased gene expression in immune cells post-flight, highlighting the need for further investigation into long-term effects as human space exploration continues to expand.
