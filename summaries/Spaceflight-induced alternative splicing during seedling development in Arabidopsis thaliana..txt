This study investigates how spaceflight affects alternative splicing in *Arabidopsis thaliana* during seedling development, revealing that exposure to microgravity induces significant changes in the transcriptome. The analysis, utilizing RNA sequencing data from plants grown on the International Space Station, illustrates the unique patterns of alternative splicing that occur in response to space conditions, providing the first evidence of its role in plant adaptation to a spaceflight environment. The findings underscore the need for further exploration of how alternative splicing contributes to physiological adjustments in plants exposed to novel abiotic stressors.
