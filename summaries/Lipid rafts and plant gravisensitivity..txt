The article discusses the role of lipid rafts, specialized microdomains within plant cell membranes, in the gravisensitivity of plants, particularly under conditions of microgravity and mechanical stress. Research indicates that these lipid rafts, which are rich in specific lipids and proteins, contribute to various physiological processes by modulating membrane function, signal transduction, and stress responses. The study suggests that lipid rafts are crucial for understanding how plants adapt to changing gravitational conditions, emphasizing their potential implications for bioregenerative life support systems in space exploration.
