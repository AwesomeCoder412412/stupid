Apyrase inhibitors have been found to enhance the effectiveness of various fungicides against different plant-pathogenic fungi. In experiments, the inhibitors significantly increased the inhibition of fungal growth when combined with fungicides like copper octanoate, myclobutanil, and propiconazole, especially in fungi like *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*. These findings suggest a mechanism where apyrase inhibitors may reduce the efflux of fungicides from fungal cells, potentially improving their potency in agricultural applications against crop disease.
