Research conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) examined how microgravity affects the Arabidopsis zigzag-1 (zig-1) mutant, particularly focusing on vacuole fusion in root cells. Findings revealed that microgravity enhances the zig-1 phenotype by reducing hypocotyl growth and decreases the creation of vacuole fusion upon treatment with Wortmannin. The study demonstrated the potential for chemical treatments in space and highlighted the feasibility of using plant cell biology experiments in microgravity environments, although it also indicated that the microgravity conditions may lead to delayed vacuole fusion in certain cell types.
