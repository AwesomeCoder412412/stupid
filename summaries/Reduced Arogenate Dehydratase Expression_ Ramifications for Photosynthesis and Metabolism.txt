The study investigates the consequences of reduced expression of arogenate dehydratase (ADT) in Arabidopsis thaliana on photosynthesis and metabolism. It finds that the ADT mutants exhibit impaired photosynthesis, characterized by lower rates of photosynthetic electron transport, an increased ATP/ADP ratio, and overaccumulation of starch due to reduced carbon flux into phenylalanine biosynthesis. Furthermore, the altered ADT activity leads to decreased levels of secondary metabolites, including flavonoids and glucosinolates, indicating significant systemic metabolic implications that could affect plant growth and fitness.
