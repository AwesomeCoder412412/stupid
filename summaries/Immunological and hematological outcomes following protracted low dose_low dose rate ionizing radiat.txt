This study examined the immunological and hematological responses of mice to simulated microgravity and low-dose ionizing radiation after a 21-day exposure, followed by a 7-day recovery period. It found no significant changes in immune cell populations, but substantial alterations in red blood cell counts and morphology indicative of anemia suggest ongoing recovery challenges post-exposure. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed differential expression of genes related to inflammation, metabolism, and signal transduction in the spleen, indicating persistent dysregulation in immune function and hematopoiesis after simulated spaceflight conditions.
