The study presents draft genome sequences of ten Klebsiella strains isolated from different locations aboard the International Space Station (ISS), identified through whole-genome sequencing. These findings aim to facilitate comparative genomic studies between ISS strains and their Earth counterparts, which is crucial for understanding how these microbes adapt to space conditions and potential risks they pose to astronauts' health due to increased antibiotic resistance and virulence in microgravity. Overall, this research sheds light on the implications of microbial life in space for human space travel and safety.
