The study explored the in vitro generation of mechanically functional cartilage grafts using adult human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) combined with three-dimensionally woven poly(Îµ-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds. Results indicated that tightly woven scaffolds produced constructs with higher mechanical properties approaching those of normal articular cartilage, especially when cultured in oscillating bioreactors, while chondrogenic differentiation was enhanced when medium lacked serum and included specific growth factors. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using hMSC and PCL scaffolds for engineering functional cartilage in a relatively short period of 21 days, potentially advancing treatment for degenerative joint diseases.
