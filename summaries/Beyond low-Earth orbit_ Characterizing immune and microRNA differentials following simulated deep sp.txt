The study investigates the immune and microRNA responses in mice exposed to simulated deep spaceflight conditions, highlighting potential immune dysfunction caused by factors such as simulated microgravity and cosmic radiation. Results indicated unique immune profiles and cytokine responses were elicited by various types of radiation, suggesting that these exposures impacted immune organ weights and leukocyte populations, particularly T cells and B cells. Comparisons with astronaut data from low-Earth orbit missions revealed similarities in elevated inflammation, indicating that the insights gained from this research could inform future space health strategies for long-duration missions.
