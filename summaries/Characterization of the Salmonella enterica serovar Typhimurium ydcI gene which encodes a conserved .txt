The study characterizes the ydcI gene in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, which encodes a conserved DNA binding protein essential for acid stress resistance and autoregulation. The research demonstrates that a mutant strain lacking ydcI exhibits increased sensitivity to acid stress but maintains the ability to invade epithelial cells at levels comparable to the wild type; however, overexpression of ydcI enhances invasion by 2.8 times. Additionally, ydcI is shown to be part of the rpoS regulon related to stress responses, and its expression is induced under specific conditions, highlighting its potential role in bacterial virulence and biofilm formation.
