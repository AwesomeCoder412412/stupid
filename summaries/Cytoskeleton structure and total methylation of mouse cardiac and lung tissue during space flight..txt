The study investigated the effects of space flight on the cytoskeleton structure and gene expression related to methylation in mouse cardiac and lung tissues, focusing on specimens obtained from the Rodent Research-1 experiment aboard the International Space Station. Findings indicated no significant changes in the protein content of cytoskeletal elements, but notable alterations in mRNA levels of related genes were observed, suggesting that the increase in total DNA methylation may affect gene expression regulation during space flight. Specifically, while most transcription-related genes remained unchanged, a significant decrease in the mRNA expression of the cytosine demethylase Tet2 was noted, which may have contributed to the observed hypermethylation of the genome.
