The study investigates transcriptomic changes in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice after 30 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to assess the impact of long-term spaceflight on cardiac function. The analysis identified 1,147 regulated transcripts, revealing significant alterations in pathways related to cell survival, including activation of MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways, while observing minimal changes in oxidative stress and extracellular matrix components. Results suggest that the mouse heart initiates an adaptive response to microgravity, promoting cellular maintenance and survival without significant cellular senescence after the prolonged exposure to space.
