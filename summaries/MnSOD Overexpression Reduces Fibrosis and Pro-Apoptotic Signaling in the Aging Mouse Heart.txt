The study investigates the role of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) overexpression in mitigating fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging mouse heart. Findings show that MnSOD overexpression significantly reduces oxidative stress markers, collagen accumulation, and pro-apoptotic signaling in older mice, supporting the hypothesis that MnSOD serves a protective role against age-related cardiac remodeling. Ultimately, the results underscore MnSOD's potential as a cardioprotective agent in aging hearts, possibly contributing to the benefits of exercise-induced upregulation of this enzyme.
