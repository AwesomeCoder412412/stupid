The article discusses the development of the Test of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST), a relational database designed to facilitate the analysis and visualization of extensive plant spaceflight data, especially from Arabidopsis thaliana experiments. TOAST integrates various datasets related to transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics, allowing researchers to explore gene expression changes in plants exposed to space conditions, and highlights significant findings, including the marked alteration of mitochondrial function in response to spaceflight. This database addresses the complexities of analyzing vast datasets, intending to generate new hypotheses and streamline research on how plants adapt to the unique challenges of space environments.
