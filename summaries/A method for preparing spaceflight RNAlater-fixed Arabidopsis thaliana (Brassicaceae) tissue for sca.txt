The study presents a method for preparing Arabidopsis thaliana tissue fixed in RNAlater for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), aimed at maximizing the use of biological samples returned from spaceflight experiments where conventional fixation methods are limited. The protocol involves desalinating samples, dehydrating them, and using rapid freezing techniques to preserve tissue morphology effectively, resulting in high-quality SEM images. The method demonstrates that RNAlater can be useful not only for molecular studies but also for morphologic investigations, providing significant advantages for both spaceflight and ground-based experiments.
