This study aimed to validate methods for assessing the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene repertoire in mouse tissues collected during spaceflight on the International Space Station (ISS). Researchers utilized Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and compared various sample preparation techniques to determine their impact on the characterization of antibody repertoires, ultimately validating a bioinformatics workflow that successfully captured Ig gene usage without introducing bias. Findings demonstrated that whole tissue preparations, despite challenges associated with space conditions, yielded comparable results to traditional single-cell suspensions, setting a foundation for future studies on immune responses during spaceflight.
