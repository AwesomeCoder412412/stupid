This study investigated the impact of housing temperature on cancellous bone loss in male C57BL/6J mice, finding that housing at thermoneutral temperature (32°C) prevents premature bone loss, which occurs at standard room temperature (22°C). Mice housed at thermoneutral temperature exhibited higher bone formation rates and lower resorption rates, indicating a protective effect on bone metabolism. The results suggest that housing temperature is a critical factor in experimental studies on bone health, reflecting the need for careful consideration in the design of animal studies related to bone metabolism and aging.
