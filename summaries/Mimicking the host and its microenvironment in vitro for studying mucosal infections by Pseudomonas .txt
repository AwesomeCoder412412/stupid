The article discusses the importance of mimicking the host microenvironment in vitro to effectively study mucosal infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, particularly in contexts like cystic fibrosis, where patients are more susceptible to infections. It emphasizes the need for complex cell culture models that replicate physiological characteristics of human tissues, including cellular organization, mucus production, and the presence of immune responses, to better understand the host-pathogen interactions that influence infection outcomes. By advancing these model systems, researchers can enhance the translation of their findings to clinical applications and develop more effective antimicrobial treatments.
