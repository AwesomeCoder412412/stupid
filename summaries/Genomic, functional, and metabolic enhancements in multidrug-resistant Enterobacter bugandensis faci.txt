The study investigates the genomic, metabolic, and functional adaptations of multidrug-resistant Enterobacter bugandensis, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), highlighting its resistance mechanisms and persistence in the unique space environment. Analysis revealed significant genetic divergence from terrestrial strains, along with enhanced capacities for nutrient metabolism and antibiotic resistance, raising concerns about its potential pathogenicity for astronauts. The research underscores the necessity for monitoring microbial communities in confined spaces like the ISS to ensure astronaut health and safety.
