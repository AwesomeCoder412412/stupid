The study investigates the interactions between macrophages and neutrophils in response to different strains of Aspergillus fumigatus using larval zebrafish as a model. It reveals that macrophages inhibit the germination of fungal spores, creating a niche that promotes fungal persistence, while neutrophils are responsible for killing faster-germinating strains like CEA10 more effectively than slower strains like Af293. Ultimately, the research demonstrates that the germination of A. fumigatus is crucial for neutrophil recruitment and fungal clearance, highlighting complex host-pathogen interactions with implications for immunotherapy strategies against invasive fungal infections.
