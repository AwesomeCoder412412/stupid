The study investigates the nephrotoxic effects of low-viscosity low-osmolar contrast media (LOCM) and iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM) using a three-dimensional kidney-on-a-chip model under varying iodine concentrations and shear stress conditions. Findings reveal that LOCM exhibits higher cytotoxicity than IOCM under static and low-shear conditions; however, at higher shear stresses, both contrast media induce similar nephrotoxic responses, emphasizing the critical role of viscosity-induced nephrotoxicity. This research highlights the utility of the kidney-on-a-chip model in understanding the rheological effects of contrast media on kidney cells, offering insights into the mechanisms underlying contrast-induced nephropathy.
