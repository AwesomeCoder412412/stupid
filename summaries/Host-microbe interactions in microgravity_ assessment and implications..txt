The article examines the impacts of microgravity on host-microbe interactions, highlighting how spaceflight stressors can disrupt these relationships at the genetic and physiological levels. It discusses how alterations in the microbiome can affect the health of both humans and plants during space travel, potentially leading to increased susceptibility to pathogens and changes in immune responses. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for maintaining health in long-duration space missions as humankind explores beyond Earth.
