The study demonstrates that culturing human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) in microgravity conditions combined with microspheres significantly enhances the selective proliferation of highly functional stem cells marked by SSEA-3 positivity. Under these conditions, hASCs showed increased expression of pluripotent markers and improved abilities for proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis compared to traditional culture methods. This innovative approach may advance regenerative therapies by better retaining the stemness and functionality of hASCs.
