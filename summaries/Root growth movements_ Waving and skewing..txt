The study investigates the role of TNO1, a trans-Golgi network-localized SNARE-interacting protein, in modulating root skewing and epidermal cell file rotation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Knockout mutants lacking TNO1 exhibit enhanced root skewing and increased cell file rotation, independent of microtubule array orientation, suggesting that TNO1 influences root movement through microtubule dynamics and cell morphology maintenance. The findings highlight TNO1's importance in root development and its potential link to auxin transport and cell wall dynamics affecting root growth patterns.
