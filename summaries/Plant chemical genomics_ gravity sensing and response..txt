The article reviews the genomic sequencing of the first terrestrial fungal lineages, particularly zygomycete fungi (Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota), highlighting significant insights gained from these studies. Key findings reveal phylogenetic distinctions between the two major clades and adaptations that allowed fungi to thrive on land, such as light and gravity sensing mechanisms, as well as the evolutionary significance of symbiotic relationships with early plants. The research underscores the role of genomic data in understanding fungal evolution, ecological interactions, and potential biotechnological applications while emphasizing ongoing efforts to improve genome quality and diversity.
