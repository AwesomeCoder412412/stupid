The study investigates the locomotion of *Caenorhabditis elegans* in three-dimensional (3D) environments, emphasizing the importance of roll maneuvers for their active reorientation in such media. It identifies a unique behavioral pattern called a "roll maneuver," which, when combined with planar turns, allows the nematode to effectively explore its surroundings. This research offers insights into 3D neuromuscular mechanics and the development of better assays for analyzing locomotion phenotypes, enhancing our understanding of the nematodeâ€™s movement capabilities both in natural and experimental contexts.
