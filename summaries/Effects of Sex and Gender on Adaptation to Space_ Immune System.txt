The article explores the hypothesis that sub-optimal hydration prior to COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of mortality through several physiological pathways. Chronic dehydration could lead to higher levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the lungs, a pre-set hyperreactive immune response, increased capillary leakage, and limited fluid transport out of the airways, all of which could exacerbate the severity of COVID-19. The authors suggest that public health interventions focused on improving hydration may help reduce COVID-19 mortality and associated disparities.
