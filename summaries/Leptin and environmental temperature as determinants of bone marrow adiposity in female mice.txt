The study examines the effects of leptin and environmental temperature on bone marrow adiposity (BMAT) in female mice. It was found that housing female mice at thermoneutral temperatures (32°C) resulted in higher BMAT levels compared to those at room temperature (22°C), while leptin supplementation decreased BMAT. The research concludes that both leptin signaling and environmental temperature independently regulate BMAT levels, with increased temperature promoting BMAT accrual while leptin serves as a negative regulator.
