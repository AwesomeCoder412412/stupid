The study investigates the impact of reduced mechanical loading, through partial weight-bearing (PWB), on skeletal health in rats. It finds that varying levels of PWB (20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight) for periods of 1 to 4 weeks result in progressive loss of trabecular bone density and microarchitecture, with effects being proportional to the degree of PWB and no evident plateau in bone loss within the observed timeframe. In contrast, alterations in cortical bone density were minimal, indicating a pronounced response of trabecular bone to mechanical unloading.
