The study focuses on a highly elastic spring-like region within the UNC-89 protein (obscurin), which is crucial for the organization of muscle sarcomeres in *C. elegans*. This interkinase region, lacking predicted secondary structure, behaves like a random coil and is vital for maintaining proper sarcomere assembly and whole-animal locomotion. Deletion of this region results in severe structural disorganization of muscle tissues and impaired movement, highlighting its importance in muscle function.
