NASA's GeneLab platform has been instrumental in analyzing biological responses to space radiation through various studies involving animal models. This research has identified distinct biological signatures associated with specific radiation exposure, revealing shifts in mitochondrial function, immune pathways, and ribosomal assembly, which could inform health risk assessments for astronauts. The findings underscore the potential health implications of prolonged exposure to cosmic radiation, especially concerning DNA damage and cancer risk, and highlight the utility of GeneLab's extensive dataset in shedding light on these critical issues.
