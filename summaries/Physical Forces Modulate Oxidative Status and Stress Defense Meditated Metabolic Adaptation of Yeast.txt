The study investigates how physical forces influence the oxidative status and stress defense mechanisms in giant colonies of yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) under conditions of microgravity and simulated microgravity. Findings reveal that various environmental cues, such as ammonia production and shear stress, affect metabolic adaptations and apoptosis in yeast colonies. The results indicate that both true microgravity and simulated conditions produce unique responses in yeast, particularly impacting gene expression related to stress responses and oxidative status, offering insights into cellular behavior under altered gravity conditions.
