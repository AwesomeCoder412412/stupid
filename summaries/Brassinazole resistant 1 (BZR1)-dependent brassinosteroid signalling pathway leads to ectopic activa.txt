The Brassinazole-resistant 1 (BZR1)-dependent brassinosteroid signaling pathway is implicated in activating quiescent cell divisions while inhibiting the differentiation of columella stem cells in the roots of *Arabidopsis*. Specifically, BZR1 positively influences division in the quiescent center and modulates the expression of auxin transport proteins, which alters auxin distribution. This differential regulation highlights the intricate roles that brassinosteroids play in root development, functioning in a concentration- and BZR1/BES1-dependent manner to balance cell division and differentiation processes.
