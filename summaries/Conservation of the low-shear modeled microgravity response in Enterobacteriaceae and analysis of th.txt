This study explores the conservation of the low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) response across various Enterobacteriaceae species and investigates the roles of trp operon genes in this response. The findings indicate that the LSMMG response is conserved but may vary in terms of gene regulation across different genera, with the trp genes not being directly involved in this response under the tested conditions. This research enhances the understanding of bacterial behavior in microgravity-like environments and could inform future bacterial engineering efforts.
