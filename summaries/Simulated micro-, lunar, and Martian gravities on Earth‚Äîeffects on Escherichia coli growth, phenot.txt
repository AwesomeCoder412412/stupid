This study investigates the effects of simulated microgravity, lunar, and Martian gravities on the growth dynamics, phenotypic changes, and antibiotic sensitivity of three strains of *Escherichia coli*. Using inclined clinostats to simulate these gravitational conditions, the researchers found that certain strains exhibited increased growth rates under simulated microgravity and lunar gravities, while higher concentrations of antibiotics were needed under lunar conditions compared to micro- and Martian gravities. The results highlight important insights into bacterial behavior in altered gravitational environments, which could impact human health during space missions.
