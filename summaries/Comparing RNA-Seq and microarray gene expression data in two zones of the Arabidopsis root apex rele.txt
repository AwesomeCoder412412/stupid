The study compared RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and microarray techniques to analyze gene expression in two zones of the Arabidopsis root apex, focusing on samples relevant to spaceflight. Both methods were effective, revealing a total of 4180 differentially expressed genes, but RNA-Seq identified 771 unique genes and 19 novel transcriptionally active regions that microarrays missed. Conversely, microarrays detected some spaceflight-relevant genes that RNA-Seq did not, suggesting that while RNA-Seq is more efficient in uncovering novel and unique gene information, both techniques have complementary strengths for analyzing small and rare plant samples.
