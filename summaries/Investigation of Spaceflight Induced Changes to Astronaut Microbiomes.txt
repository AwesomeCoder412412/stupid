The study investigates how microgravity affects the gut microbiota of mice and its implications on liver and brain metabolism, using a 3D-Clinostat to simulate microgravity conditions. Findings indicate that microgravity disrupts gut microbiota diversity and serum metabolite profiles, resulting in significant abnormalities in liver and brain functions, including lipid and amino acid metabolism. The research suggests an intricate relationship between microgravity-induced dysbiosis and metabolic dysfunction, providing insights into potential impacts on astronaut health during space missions.
