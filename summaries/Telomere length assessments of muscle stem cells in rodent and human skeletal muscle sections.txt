The study presents a protocol for assessing telomere length in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) using quantitative fluorescent in-situ hybridization (CRYO MuQ-FISH) on skeletal muscle cryosections, allowing analysis within their native environment. This method overcomes limitations found in traditional telomere length assessment techniques by enabling single-cell resolution while preserving muscle tissue structure, making it applicable to both rodent and human samples. The results can provide insights into cellular dysfunction related to diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, highlighting its relevance in muscle biology research.
