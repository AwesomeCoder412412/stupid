This study investigates the role of protein kinase 2 (PK2) in the giant sarcomeric protein UNC-89 and its impact on mitochondrial morphology and function in *C. elegans*. Mutations that inactivate PK2 lead to unexpectedly normal muscle structure and enhanced locomotion, despite causing mitochondrial fragmentation. The findings suggest that PK2 is crucial for signaling between sarcomeres and mitochondria, effectively linking energy production with muscle contraction demands, and that heightened ATP levels in PK2 mutants may result from increased glycolysis and altered mitochondrial respiration.
