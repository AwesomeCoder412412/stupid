The study investigates the molecular mechanisms that contribute to improved functions of primary mouse hepatocytes when cultured in three-dimensional (3D) aggregates, specifically in rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors, compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) monolayers. Results show that 3D culture leads to enhanced expression of hepatocyte-specific genes, particularly those associated with metabolic functions, while reducing markers of mesenchymal transition typically seen in 2D cultures. The transcription factor Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4Î± (Hnf4a) plays a crucial role as a master regulator of these functions, underscoring the significance of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining hepatocyte identity and functionality.
