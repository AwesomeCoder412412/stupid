The study investigates TNO1, a trans-Golgi network-localized protein, in Arabidopsis thaliana and its role in modulating root skewing. It finds that TNO1 is a negative regulator of root skewing; mutations in TNO1 lead to increased skewing and altered cell file rotation independent of microtubule array orientation. The research suggests that TNO1 impacts root movement through microtubules and is essential for maintaining proper cell morphology and expansion during root growth, with potential implications for enhancing crop root architecture in varying soil conditions.
