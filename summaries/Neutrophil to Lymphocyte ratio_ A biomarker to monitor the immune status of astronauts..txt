The article discusses the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a potential biomarker for monitoring the immune health of astronauts during spaceflight, given evidence that space travel induces immune dysfunction. Research showed that both astronauts in space and rodents subjected to simulated microgravity exhibited elevated NLR levels, suggesting that oxidative stress and inflammation are heightened in these conditions. The study proposes that monitoring NLR can help identify immune deviations and prevent health issues in astronauts on long-duration missions, with antioxidant treatments potentially serving as countermeasures to mitigate inflammation.
