The study investigates the effects of microgravity on seedling growth and gene expression in three accessions of **Brachypodium distachyon** (Bd21, Bd21-3, Gaz8) grown on the International Space Station (ISS). Results indicated that exposure to microgravity caused accession-specific morphological changes, such as slower root growth and longer root hairs, along with significant alterations in gene expression profiles, particularly concerning oxidative stress and photosynthesis-related pathways. The findings suggest that monocot plants exhibit distinct adaptive responses to the microgravity environment, emphasizing the need for further research to enhance the cultivation strategies of crops for space exploration.
