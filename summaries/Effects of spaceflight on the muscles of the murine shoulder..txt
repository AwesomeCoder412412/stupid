The study investigates the effects of muscle unloading on the supraspinatus muscle enthesis in adult mice, specifically after a 21-day paralysis induced by botulinum toxin A. The findings reveal significant increases in mechanical failure risk associated with structural changes across multiple hierarchical scales, including bone loss at the millimeter scale, diminished bioapatite crystal size and alignment at the micrometer level, and altered mineral composition at the atomic level. These results highlight the enthesis's sensitivity to loading conditions and suggest that unloading may compromise its mechanical properties, increasing the likelihood of injury.
