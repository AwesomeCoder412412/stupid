The vacuolar H+/Ca transporter CAX1 plays a critical role in plant responses to submergence and anoxia stress. Research shows that Arabidopsis mutants lacking CAX1 exhibit enhanced tolerance to both low oxygen conditions and flooding, with significant alterations in metabolic processes, reduced production of reactive oxygen species, and changes in calcium signaling during reoxygenation. These findings suggest the potential for engineering CAX1-related pathways to improve flood tolerance in crops to mitigate agricultural losses during adverse environmental conditions.
