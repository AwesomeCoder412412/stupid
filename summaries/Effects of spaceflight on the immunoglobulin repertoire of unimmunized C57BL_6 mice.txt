The study investigated the effects of spaceflight on the immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice, using high-throughput sequencing to compare B-cell responses from mice flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) with ground control mice. The results showed that, while individual gene segment usage was similar between the treatment groups, variations were observed in gene segment combinations and junctions, indicating a high degree of individual variability; however, spaceflight did not significantly affect the overall B-cell repertoire. Ultimately, the findings suggest that a short-duration spaceflight did not disrupt the recombinatorial processes that lead to Ig diversity in the mouse model examined.
