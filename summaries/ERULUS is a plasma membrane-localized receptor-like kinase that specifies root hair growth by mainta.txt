The study focuses on the receptor-like kinase ERULUS (ERU) in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, which is localized to the plasma membrane and regulates root hair growth by maintaining tip-focused cytoplasmic calcium (Ca²⁺) oscillations. Previous research suggested that ERU was involved in ammonium (NH₄⁺) homeostasis, but the new findings indicate that ERU's primary function is linked to its role in Ca²⁺ signaling rather than NH₄⁺ signaling. The research emphasizes the importance of ERU in sustaining root hair growth by preserving normal oscillations of intracellular calcium, challenging the previous models surrounding its function.
