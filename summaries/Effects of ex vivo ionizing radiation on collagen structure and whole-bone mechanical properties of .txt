This study investigates the impact of ex vivo ionizing radiation on the collagen structure and mechanical properties of mouse vertebrae. It finds that collagen fragmentation, particularly at doses of 17,000 Gy and above, primarily contributes to reductions in bone strength and mechanical properties, while non-enzymatic collagen cross-linking appears to have a lesser role. The research suggests that radiation-induced changes in collagen structure may increase fracture risk and highlights the need for protective measures when using radiation for sterilizing bone grafts.
