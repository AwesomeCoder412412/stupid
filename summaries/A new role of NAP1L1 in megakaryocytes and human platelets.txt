The study investigates the role of nuclear assembly protein 1-like 1 (NAP1L1) in megakaryocytes and platelets, revealing its expression in these cells and its interaction with the mitochondrial protein PDC-E2, a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). Findings indicate that sepsis alters NAP1L1 expression and PDH activity in platelets, with NAP1L1 overexpression leading to reduced proplatelet formation from megakaryocytes, implying NAP1L1 has roles beyond nucleosome assembly, particularly in energy metabolism during inflammatory responses. The research suggests a significant interplay between the MK-PLT axis and metabolic functions under septic conditions, warranting further exploration of
