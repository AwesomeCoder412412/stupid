The study focused on employing a machine learning algorithm to assess antibiotic resistance genes within the microbial communities on the International Space Station (ISS). Using shotgun metagenomics data from various locations on the ISS, researchers analyzed over 200 cultivable strains and identified multiple antibiotic resistance genes, particularly highlighting the potential pathogenicity of certain strains, including *Enterobacter bugandensis* and *Kalamiella piersonii*. The findings revealed that deep learning models could uncover significant insights into antimicrobial resistance in space environments, enhancing understanding of microbial behavior during extended space missions.
