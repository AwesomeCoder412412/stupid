Research led by Rui Li identifies glutathione (GSH) as a crucial signaling molecule that facilitates calcium-based plant defense signaling in response to wounding or herbivory in **Arabidopsis**. The study demonstrates that GSH deficiency leads to impaired defense responses despite the accumulation of glutamate, another known wound signal, suggesting that GSH is essential for activating systemic calcium signaling and jasmonic acid biosynthesis necessary for effective plant defenses. This work advances the understanding of complex plant communication mechanisms and their evolution in response to environmental challenges.
