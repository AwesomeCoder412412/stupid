The study presents a method called PicoShells, which involves encapsulating and desiccating yeast cells to enable clonal analyses of microbes in outer space. These hollow hydrogel microparticles maintain their morphology and the health of encapsulated cells after desiccation, allowing for effective rehydration and subsequent growth analysis. This innovative approach supports high-throughput, single-cell assessments of microbial populations, crucial for advancing biotechnologies and understanding cellular responses in space exploration contexts.
