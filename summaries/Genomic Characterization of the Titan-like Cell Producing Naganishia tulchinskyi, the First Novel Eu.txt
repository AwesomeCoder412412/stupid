The article discusses the isolation and genomic characterization of a novel yeast species, *Naganishia tulchinskyi*, identified from environmental surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These yeast strains exhibited unique Titan-like cell morphology when grown under simulated microgravity and 5% CO2 conditions, showing distinct physical characteristics such as larger size and thicker cell walls compared to those grown on Earth. Genetic analyses revealed pathways related to cold adaptation, radiation resistance, and novel morphological traits, suggesting these yeasts may have evolved specific mechanisms to thrive in extreme space environments.
