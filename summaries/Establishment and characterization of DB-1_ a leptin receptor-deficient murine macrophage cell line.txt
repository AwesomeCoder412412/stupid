The study describes the establishment and characterization of a murine macrophage cell line, DB-1, which is deficient in leptin receptors. This cell line was created from bone marrow cells of leptin receptor-deficient mice and exhibits properties typical of macrophages, including diploidy, phagocytic activity, and response to certain cytokines, but does not respond to leptin or adipocyte-conditioned media. The DB-1 cell line serves as a valuable tool for investigating the role of the leptin receptor in immune regulation, particularly in the context of obesity-related inflammation.
