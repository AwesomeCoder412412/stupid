The study discusses the role of extracellular purine nucleotides, particularly ATP and ADP, in regulating various plant responses, including growth, immune defense, and stress adaptation. It highlights that these nucleotides can trigger calcium influx through plasma membrane channels in *Arabidopsis thaliana* roots, especially in response to physical damage and stress conditions. The findings suggest a complex signaling network involving abscisic acid and glutamate that modulates ATP release and subsequent calcium signaling, ultimately impacting root development and stress responses.
