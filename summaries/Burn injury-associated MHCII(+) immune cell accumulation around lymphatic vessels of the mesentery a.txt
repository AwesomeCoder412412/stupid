The study investigates the effects of burn injury on immune cell accumulation and lymphatic endothelial permeability in a rat model, focusing on MHCII+ immune cells around mesenteric lymphatic vessels. Findings reveal that burn injuries lead to a significant increase in the number and altered morphology of these immune cells, as well as enhanced permeability of lymphatic endothelium. Treatment with doxycycline effectively reduces immune cell accumulation and preserves lymphatic endothelial barrier integrity, highlighting its potential therapeutic role in mitigating the systemic effects of burn injuries.
