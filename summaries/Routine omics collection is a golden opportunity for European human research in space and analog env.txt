Routine omics collection has the potential to significantly enhance human research in space and analog environments in Europe, offering insights into the physiological impacts of spaceflight on health. Advances in technology, combined with the growing number of space missions, present an opportunity for standardized, longitudinal data collection that could inform personalized medicine approaches for astronauts. Key considerations for implementing this program include the selection of omic types and sampling methods, as well as addressing ethical and legal frameworks to protect participants' data while maximizing scientific benefit.
