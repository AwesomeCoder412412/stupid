A study investigated the long-term proteomic and phosphoproteomic effects on cardiovascular tissues in mice following exposure to simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR5-ion). At eight months post-irradiation, significant changes in protein expression and phosphorylation patterns were noted, including alterations in inflammatory pathways and evidence of increased neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in heart tissue, suggesting potential risks for cardiovascular health in astronauts during long-term space missions. These findings indicate that exposure to space radiation may lead to sustained biological changes that could contribute to cardiovascular dysfunction.
