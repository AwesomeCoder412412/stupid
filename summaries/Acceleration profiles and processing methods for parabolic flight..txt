The article presents a comprehensive framework for collecting and analyzing data from parabolic flights, which simulate reduced gravity environments for space research. Researchers led by Christopher E. Carr developed a method that employs a small accelerometer to measure gravito-inertial accelerations (GIA) during a series of parabolas flown on a Boeing 727-200F. This open-source approach not only allows consistent classification of flight phases but also provides freely accessible data and analysis tools to facilitate future research in both academic and commercial space endeavors.
