This study investigates the microbiome of a crew member aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and its influence on the microbial composition of habitable surfaces. By analyzing samples from the crew memberâ€™s body (including saliva, skin, and nasal swabs) and various ISS surfaces over multiple time points, researchers found that the microbiome of the crew member's skin was closely related to that of the ISS surfaces, particularly during the flight. The findings highlight the potential impact of a crew member's microbiome on the ISS environment, which is important for long-term space missions.
