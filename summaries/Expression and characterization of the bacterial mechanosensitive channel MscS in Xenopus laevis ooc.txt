MscS-Like10 (MSL10) is a mechanosensitive ion channel from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana that demonstrates stretch-activated behavior with a preference for anions. Through electrophysiological experiments in Xenopus laevis oocytes, it was established that MSL10 has a conductance of approximately 100 pS, allowing it to respond to mechanical stimuli by facilitating ion movement, particularly chloride ions, across the membrane. This channel's activities suggest it may play a critical role in plant responses to mechanical stress and osmotic changes, thereby contributing to stress signaling and homeostasis in plant cells.
