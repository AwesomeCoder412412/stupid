Researchers developed a high-precision method for cyclic loading of isolated mouse vertebrae to assess bone quality, addressing the challenges posed by the small size of the specimens. This method utilizes 3D-printed support jigs, pivotable loading platens, and micro-CT-based finite element analysis to ensure uniform loading and measure the mechanical properties accurately. The results indicate that this new approach significantly reduces variability in fatigue life measurements compared to conventional methods, thus enhancing the ability to detect relevant changes in bone quality related to diseases or treatments.
