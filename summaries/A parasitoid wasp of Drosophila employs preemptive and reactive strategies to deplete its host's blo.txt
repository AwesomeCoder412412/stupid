The study investigates the strategies employed by the parasitoid wasp *Leptopilina heterotoma* to subdue its *Drosophila* hosts by delving into the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) to deplete host blood cells and modify immune responses. The research reveals that these EVs disrupt the function of the host's hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, by inducing apoptosis in essential immune cells, thereby preventing the host's ability to encapsulate and resist the wasp. Ultimately, the findings highlight a dual strategy of preemptive and reactive actions taken by the wasp to ensure its survival and breeding success in a host capable of immune defense.
