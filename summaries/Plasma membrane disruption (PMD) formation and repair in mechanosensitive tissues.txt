The text reviews the mechanisms and significance of plasma membrane disruptions (PMD) and their repair in mechanosensitive tissues, highlighting their role in cellular adaptation to mechanical stress. PMD formation, triggered by various mechanical forces, facilitates crucial intracellular signaling, thus influencing the physiological behavior of various cell types, including those in bone, muscle, and epithelial tissues. The review emphasizes that understanding PMD dynamics and repair processes can inform therapeutic strategies for conditions related to mechanobiology and tissue health.
