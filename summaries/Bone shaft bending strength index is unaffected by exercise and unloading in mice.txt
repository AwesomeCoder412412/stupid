Research indicates that bone shaft bending strength index in mice does not significantly change in response to varying levels of physical activity, as demonstrated through exercise and unloading experiments. Specifically, while exercise improved certain metrics of femoral mid-shaft structure, it did not increase the bending strength index, and unloading led to diminished bone growth without altering the index. These findings suggest that the application of the bending strength index as a measure of historical physical activity levels in humans should be approached with caution.
