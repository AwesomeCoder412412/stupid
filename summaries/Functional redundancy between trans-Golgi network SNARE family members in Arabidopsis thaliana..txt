Researchers identified a novel protein named AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana Glycosyl Transferase-Like Protein) in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, which is localized to the Golgi apparatus, specifically the trans-Golgi network. Characterized as a putative glycosyltransferase due to its amino acid sequence similarities with metazoan fucosyltransferases, AtGTLP remains uncharacterized but suggests a potential role in glycosylation processes in plants. Despite the lack of phenotypic differences observed in *atgtlp−/−* mutants compared to wild-type plants, further exploration may reveal redundant functions with similar proteins.
