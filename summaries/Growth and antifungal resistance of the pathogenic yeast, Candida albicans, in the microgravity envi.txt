This study examines the effects of microgravity on the growth and antifungal resistance of Candida albicans, a pathogenic yeast, during several missions on the International Space Station (ISS). The findings demonstrate that C. albicans exhibited increased growth rates and antifungal resistance, particularly to amphotericin B, in a microgravity environment compared to terrestrial controls, while showing low levels of filamentation and similar colony morphology across different cultivation conditions. The research emphasizes the need to understand microbial behavior in space for crew safety, particularly regarding opportunistic pathogens like C. albicans.
