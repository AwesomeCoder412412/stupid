This study investigates the proteomic and metabolomic characteristics of extremophilic fungi, specifically strains associated with the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and the International Space Station (ISS), under simulated Mars conditions (SMC). The findings reveal that while several fungal strains survived brief exposure to SMC, only specific strains showed notable survival after 30 minutes, with significant differences in their proteomic responses observed, particularly related to translation and carbohydrate metabolism. The results suggest that exposure to SMC may enhance UV-C resistance in certain fungal strains, highlighting their potential role in microbial contamination during future space missions.
