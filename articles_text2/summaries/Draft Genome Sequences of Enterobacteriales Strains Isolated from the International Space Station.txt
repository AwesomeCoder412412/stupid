Researchers have sequenced the genomes of 26 bacterial strains belonging to the order Enterobacteriales, isolated from surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). These strains, including Pantoea brenneri and Enterobacter bugandensis, are noteworthy due to their potential pathogenicity and their ability to adapt to the unique conditions of space. Analyzing their genetic makeup could help identify mechanisms of pathogenicity that may pose health risks to astronauts on long-duration missions.
