Brassinosteroids, specifically epi-brassinolide (eBL), influence root gravitropism by modifying filamentous-actin (F-actin) organization and dynamics. Research showed that roots treated with eBL exhibited enhanced gravitropic responses similar to those treated with the actin inhibitor Latrunculin B (LatB), which inhibited autotropic root straightening. The effects of eBL and LatB were found to originate from altered actin structures, with eBL having a milder influence on F-actin compared to LatB, suggesting that brassinosteroids play an important role in the regulatory mechanisms of root growth.
