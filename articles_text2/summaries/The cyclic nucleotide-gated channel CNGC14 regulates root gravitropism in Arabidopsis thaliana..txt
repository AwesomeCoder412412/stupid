The AUX1-AFB1-CNGC14 module in Arabidopsis thaliana regulates a specific longitudinal pH profile along root surfaces, displaying distinct acidic and alkaline zones that play crucial roles in root navigation and growth. The research indicates that the alkaline domain formed at the root transition zone is not merely a result of AHA ATPase activity but is significantly influenced by auxin response mechanisms, particularly involving the AUX1, AFB1, and CNGC14 proteins. The study also reveals that this dynamic pH profile is critical for the plant's gravitropic responses, facilitating efficient root growth through variable soil environments.
