This study evaluates the effectiveness of film media (Easy Plates and Petrifilm) compared to traditional agar media in estimating microbial burden in food items, built environments, and the International Space Station (ISS). Results show that film media performed comparably to agar for cultivable bacterial counts in food and built environments, with high correlation values (RÂ² = 0.94-0.96), although there were discrepancies in fungal counts and some limitations concerning detection in low-biomass settings like the ISS. Overall, the findings suggest that film media are viable alternatives for microbial monitoring, particularly in environments with very low microbial presence, such as cleanrooms and space habitats.
