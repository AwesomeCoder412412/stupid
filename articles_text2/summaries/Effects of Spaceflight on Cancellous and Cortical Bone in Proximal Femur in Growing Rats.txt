The study investigates the effects of spaceflight on cancellous and cortical bone in the proximal femur of growing rats, revealing that spaceflight leads to cancellous osteopenia, specifically noted in both male Fisher 344 and ovariectomized female rats. The research involved analyzing archived bone specimens from three separate missions, demonstrating significant reductions in cancellous bone volume fraction in flight animals compared to ground controls. These findings underscore the detrimental impacts of microgravity on bone health, particularly relevant for long-duration space missions where astronauts may experience significant bone loss in the proximal femur.
