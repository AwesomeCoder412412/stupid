The study describes the identification and genomic analysis of a novel bacterium, Cohnella hashimotonis sp. nov., isolated from the International Space Station. This gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium exhibits characteristics that distinguish it from closely related species within the Cohnella genus, including unique fatty acid profiles and the ability to metabolize various carbon compounds. The research underscores the importance of studying space microbiomes for understanding microbial evolution in closed environments and potential applications for biotechnological innovations.
