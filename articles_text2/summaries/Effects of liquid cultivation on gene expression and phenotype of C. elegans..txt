The study investigates the effects of liquid cultivation on gene expression and phenotype in the model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans*, focusing on two strains: laboratory strain N2 and wild-isolate AB1. Results indicate significant differences in transcriptional responses between the two strains when subjected to liquid culture, showing that 8-34% of environmental changes-induced transcriptional alterations are inherited by subsequent generations. Additionally, functional analysis of gene expression changes reveals correlations with observed phenotypical differences, including reproductive system changes and body morphology variations, emphasizing the importance of genotype and environmental context in adaptive responses.
