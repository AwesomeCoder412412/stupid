A study conducted on the roots of *Arabidopsis thaliana* in microgravity conditions revealed a novel positive phototropic response to blue light, which was previously masked by the dominant gravitropic response on Earth. This unique response was attenuated in environments with gravity levels above 0.1g, while a red-light pretreatment before blue light exposure enhanced the phototropic curvature. The research highlights significant findings about the interaction between light and gravity in plant growth and suggests that understanding these responses is crucial for future space exploration and habitation.
