The study conducted on Drosophila revealed that both hypergravity and spaceflight significantly impact the immune response mediated by the Toll signaling pathway. Hypergravity was found to enhance survival against fungal infections, suggesting an improved immune function, while spaceflight resulted in a compromised Toll response, failing to activate key antimicrobial peptides after fungal infections, though the Imd pathway remained functional during bacterial infections. These findings underscore the differential effects of varying gravitational conditions on immune responses, potentially informing countermeasures for long-term human space exploration.
