This study investigates how spaceflight affects the salivary microbiome of astronauts and its potential implications for viral reactivation. Analysis of saliva from ten astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight revealed significant changes in microbial composition, particularly a decrease in diversity and variations in specific bacterial genera linked to viral loads, notably Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). These findings suggest that the alteration of the microbiome during space travel could influence astronaut health by affecting viral reactivation, highlighting the need for further research to develop strategies for disease prevention in space.
