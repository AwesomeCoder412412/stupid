The research focuses on the role of nucleolin mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana to understand plant adaptive responses to stress from spaceflight conditions, particularly regarding ribosome biogenesis. The study highlights how different light conditions (red light vs. darkness) impact gene expression and the functional roles of nucleolin genes NUC1 and NUC2, with NUC1 being essential for optimal responses. Findings indicate that the absence of NUC1 results in reduced adaptability under stress, suggesting implications for future space agriculture and the importance of Earth reference controls in space research.
