This review discusses the detrimental effects of spaceflight exposure, primarily microgravity and radiation, on skeletal and vascular health through the lens of redox signaling and oxidative stress. Research indicates that these environmental stresses contribute to musculoskeletal dysfunction, including osteopenia, and impair vascular responses, likely due to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced antioxidant defenses. The findings highlight the importance of understanding these mechanisms for developing effective countermeasures to mitigate spaceflight-induced health risks.
