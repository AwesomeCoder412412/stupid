The study presents draft genome sequences of 20 biosafety level 2 opportunistic pathogens isolated from the International Space Station's surfaces. These sequences will facilitate research into the impact of microgravity on the pathogenicity and virulence of these strains compared to their Earth counterparts. Notable findings include the presence of multidrug-resistant strains of *Staphylococcus* and *Enterobacter*, highlighting potential health risks for astronauts.
