Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is an effective rehabilitation tool that enhances muscle strength and size in load-compromised individuals by facilitating muscle hypertrophy at lower loads. This method, which involves occluding blood flow to working muscles, can improve recovery, mitigate disuse atrophy, and contribute to overall athlete resiliency by providing a progressive training stimulus without the need for heavy weights. Although BFRT is beneficial for recovery and injury prevention, it should be applied cautiously, particularly in individuals with cardiovascular concerns.
