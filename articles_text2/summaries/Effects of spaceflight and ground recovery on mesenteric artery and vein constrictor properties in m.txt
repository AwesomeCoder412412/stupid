The study investigated the effects of spaceflight on the vasoconstrictor properties of mesenteric arteries and veins in mice, revealing that microgravity significantly impairs the ability to constrict these blood vessels in response to stimuli like norepinephrine. The results indicated reduced vasoconstriction in both arteries and veins following spaceflight, linked to lower ryanodine receptor mRNA levels, which suggests a compromised intracellular calcium release mechanism. Recovery of vasoconstrictor function occurred within a week post-flight, highlighting the potential implications for astronauts' cardiovascular health during orthostatic challenges after returning to Earth.
