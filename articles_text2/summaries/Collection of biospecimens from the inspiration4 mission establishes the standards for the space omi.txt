The biospecimen collection from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission has established important standards for the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), enabling a detailed understanding of how spaceflight impacts human biology. Over 2,900 samples, including blood, saliva, urine, and skin biopsies, were collected at multiple time points before, during, and after the flight to facilitate comprehensive multi-omic analyses. This initiative aims to enhance our knowledge of space-related health effects and improve standards for future commercial and scientific space missions.
