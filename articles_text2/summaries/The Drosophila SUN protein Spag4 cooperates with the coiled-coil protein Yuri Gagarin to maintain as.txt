The Drosophila SUN protein Spag4 plays a critical role in maintaining the association between the basal body and the spermid nucleus during spermatogenesis, collaborating with the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Spag4 is essential for centriole and nuclear attachment, and its absence leads to significant defects in sperm cell development, including the dissociation of centrioles from nuclei and failure in spermatid individualization. This study highlights a unique mechanism by which Spag4 mediates these interactions independently of typical KASH protein partners, indicating a complex relationship involving dynein-dynactin and Yuri in the context of centriolar-nuclear attachment.
