Research on the effects of extended microgravity on articular cartilage (AC) and sternal fibrocartilage (SC) has revealed significant differences in their responses. Mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity showed degradation in AC, indicated by reduced proteoglycan staining and altered gene expression linked to cartilage matrix proteins, while SC exhibited no signs of deterioration and a distinct gene expression profile suggesting better preservation. These findings imply that the biomechanical environment, characterized by load-bearing in AC versus minimal loading in SC, plays a crucial role in determining the cartilage's response to microgravity.
