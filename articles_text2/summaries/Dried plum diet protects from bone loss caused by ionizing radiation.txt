A study published in Scientific Reports indicates that a diet rich in dried plums (25% by weight) can effectively prevent bone loss resulting from ionizing radiation, which is a concern for astronauts, radiotherapy patients, and radiation workers. The research found that dried plums significantly reduced the expression of genes related to bone resorption and maintained bone microarchitecture after exposure to radiation, making it a promising dietary intervention to mitigate the skeletal effects of radiation exposure. In contrast, other antioxidant or anti-inflammatory interventions, such as an antioxidant cocktail and ibuprofen, were less effective in preventing radiation-induced bone loss.
