The study investigates methods for optimizing the preservation of mammalian tissues to enhance scientific outcomes from both ground-based and spaceflight experiments. It focuses on the effects of time delays post-euthanasia and storage conditions on the quality of RNA and enzyme activity in tissues, primarily liver and spleen, demonstrating that high-quality samples can be obtained even with delayed preservation or prolonged storage at -80Â°C. The findings are relevant for improving sample collection protocols in challenging environments like space, ensuring that valuable scientific data is maximized despite logistical constraints.
