The study investigates the use of RNAlater for preserving Arabidopsis thaliana tissues in order to facilitate RNA and protein analysis, highlighting its effectiveness in maintaining RNA and protein integrity for downstream applications like RNA sequencing and proteomics. While RNAlater proved successful in preserving samples, it induced significant transcriptomic and proteomic alterations, with thousands of gene transcripts and several proteins showing differential expression, suggesting that researchers should exercise caution when using this fixative for omics-level experiments due to the potential for undesired cellular responses. This research serves as the first comprehensive comparison of RNAlater's impacts on plant tissues, emphasizing the dual nature of its utility and the caution needed in experimental design.
