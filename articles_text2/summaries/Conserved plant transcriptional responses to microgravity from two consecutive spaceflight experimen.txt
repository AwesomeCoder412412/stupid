The study investigates how plants, specifically Arabidopsis, respond to microgravity in space by analyzing transcriptional changes from two consecutive spaceflight experiments conducted aboard the International Space Station. Results reveal a significant overlap in differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two experiments, with genes related to transcriptional regulation and shoot development being upregulated in microgravity, while those involved in defense response and stress signaling were downregulated. This unique transcriptional profile underscores the impact of microgravity on plant adaptation and emphasizes the necessity of using onboard 1 g controls to accurately assess microgravity-specific effects.
