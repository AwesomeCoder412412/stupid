A study conducted aboard the International Space Station found that female C57BL/6J mice exhibited increased thermogenesis during spaceflight, evidenced by gene expression changes in their brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT). After 37 days in space, the mice showed elevated levels of Ucp1 in their BAT, indicating enhanced non-shivering thermogenesis, and alterations in WAT gene expression associated with glucose metabolism and lipid regulation. These findings suggest that the unique microgravity environment may impact thermoregulatory mechanisms, which could have implications for understanding physiological responses in astronauts.
