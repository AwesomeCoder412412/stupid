A study investigated the inhibitory effects of marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) on the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) strains. The MSGs effectively disrupted the viral spike protein's interactions with host cell receptors, demonstrating strong antiviral activity against both strains, although no structural correlations related to their activity were identified. Overall, the findings support the potential of MSGs as therapeutic agents against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants.
