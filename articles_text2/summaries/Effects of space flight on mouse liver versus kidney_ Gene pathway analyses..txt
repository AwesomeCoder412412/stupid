The study investigates the effect of spaceflight on gene expression in the liver and kidney tissues of mice, comparing those that flew in space for 12 days to ground control animals. It identifies both tissue-specific and common gene expression pathways, revealing that both organs show heightened activity in areas related to cellular responses, apoptosis, fat cell differentiation, and protein regulation. Notably, the gene pathways for T cell activation and other immune response factors were prominently affected, suggesting significant physiological changes induced by the space environment.
