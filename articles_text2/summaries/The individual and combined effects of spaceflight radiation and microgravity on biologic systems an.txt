The article discusses the health risks that astronauts face from exposure to both spaceflight radiation and microgravity during long-duration missions. It suggests that while much research has focused on these hazards individually, understanding their combined effects is crucial for protecting astronaut health and developing effective countermeasures. Ground-based analog models, particularly using rodent studies, have been highlighted to study the physiological and biological responses to simultaneous exposure to microgravity and radiation, emphasizing the need for further research to mitigate these risks during future space exploration missions.
