This study details the genomic characterization and radiation tolerance of two novel yeast species, *Naganishia kalamii* and *Cystobasidium onofrii*, isolated from NASA's Mars 2020 mission cleanroom facilities. Both species exhibit unique genomic traits and notable resistance to UV radiation, indicating adaptations to extreme environmental conditions, which is significant for preventing microbial contamination in space missions. The research highlights the importance of utilizing advanced genetic techniques for precise species identification and understanding the impact of extremophilic organisms in the context of planetary protection.
