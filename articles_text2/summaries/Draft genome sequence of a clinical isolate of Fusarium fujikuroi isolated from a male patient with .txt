The draft genome sequence of a clinical isolate of *Fusarium fujikuroi* was obtained from a 68-year-old male patient with refractory acute myeloid leukemia, who developed an infection while undergoing chemotherapy. The genome was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform, resulting in a total size of 48 Mb and providing insights into this emerging opportunistic human pathogen. This research contributes to the understanding of fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, highlighting a notable isolate in the context of healthcare-associated infections.
