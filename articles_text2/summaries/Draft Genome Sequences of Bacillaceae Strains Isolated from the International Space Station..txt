Research on Bacillaceae strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) resulted in the draft genome sequences of 29 bacterial isolates. These strains, which include *Bacillus amyloliquefaciens*, *Bacillus cereus*, and *Paenibacillus polymyxa*, will provide insight into their potential roles in space and biotechnological applications due to their resilience in harsh environments, particularly their ability to form endospores. The genomes were sequenced and analyzed for their genetic characteristics, aiding ongoing studies in planetary protection and microbiology.
