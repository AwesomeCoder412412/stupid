The study investigates the role of phosphoinositide signaling, specifically through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), in plant defense mechanisms against biotic stressors, using transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a human 5-phosphatase that reduces InsP3 levels. The results indicate that the InsP5-ptase plants exhibit diminished defense responses, characterized by impaired calcium signaling, reduced expression and induction of defense-related genes, and compromised systemic acquired resistance (SAR) to the pathogen *Pseudomonas syringae*. Overall, phosphoinositide signaling is shown to be crucial for regulating both basal and systemic plant defense responses, highlighting connections between calcium signaling, salicylic acid levels
