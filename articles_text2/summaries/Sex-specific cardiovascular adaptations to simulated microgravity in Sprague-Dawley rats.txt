This study investigates sex-specific cardiovascular adaptations in Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to simulated microgravity through hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 14 days. Results showed that female rats exhibited increased aortic stiffness and diastolic dysfunction post-HLU, linked to lower levels of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) and increased oxidative stress markers, whereas there were no significant changes in male rats. The findings underscore the need for understanding sex differences in cardiovascular responses to microgravity for developing targeted countermeasures in space exploration.
