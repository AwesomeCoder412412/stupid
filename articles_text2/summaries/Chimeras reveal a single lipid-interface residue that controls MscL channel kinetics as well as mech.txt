The study investigates how a single lipid-interface residue in the MscL mechanosensitive channel from *E. coli* and *Staphylococcus aureus* influences channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity. Chimeras created between the two species showed that specific amino acids in the periplasmic region, particularly I49 in *E. coli* and F47 in *S. aureus*, have a significant impact on channel opening times and responsiveness to membrane tension. This finding suggests that the lipid environment plays a critical role in the behavior of mechanosensitive channels, acting similarly to a spring in controlling the energy barriers for channel gating.
