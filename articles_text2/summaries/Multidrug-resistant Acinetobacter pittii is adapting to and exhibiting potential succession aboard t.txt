Multidrug-resistant *Acinetobacter pittii* has shown significant adaptation while aboard the International Space Station (ISS), evolving into a genetically and functionally distinct clade separate from Earth-bound strains. Analysis of various genomes indicates that the ISS strains have increased resistance to certain antibiotics, specifically expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, and show potential ecological succession with a notable increase in relative abundance across missions. Understanding these changes is critical for anticipating how such pathogens may behave in space and for developing effective infection prevention strategies during long-duration space missions.
