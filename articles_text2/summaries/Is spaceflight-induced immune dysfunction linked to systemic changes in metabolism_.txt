The study investigates the relationship between immune dysfunction induced by spaceflight and systemic metabolic changes. Data from the final Space Shuttle mission (STS-135) revealed that while spaceflight led to reductions in various immune cell populations and impaired phagocytic functions, it also resulted in increased activity related to oxidative stress and alterations in metabolic pathways, particularly those involving lipid metabolism and glucose production. These findings suggest a potential connection between the observed immune dysfunction and metabolic shifts, highlighting the influence of the spaceflight environment on both immune and metabolic responses.
