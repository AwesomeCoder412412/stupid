The study describes a protocol for real-time in vivo recording of calcium ion signals in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana during insect feeding, specifically by the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), utilizing a genetically-encoded fluorescent biosensor called GCaMP3. This method enables researchers to visualize localized increases in calcium concentration around the aphid feeding site within minutes, illustrating a unique plant signaling response to biotic stress. The protocol can be adapted for various insect species and offers significant insights into plant-insect interactions and the role of calcium signaling in plant defense mechanisms.
