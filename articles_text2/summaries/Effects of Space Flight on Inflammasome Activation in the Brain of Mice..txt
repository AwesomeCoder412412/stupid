A study investigated the effects of space flight on inflammasome activation in the brains of mice after a 37-day mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The findings revealed that spaceflight resulted in decreased levels of key inflammasome signaling proteins like caspase-1 and IL-1Î² in the brains of the mice compared to ground controls, indicating that the innate immune response was impaired by space conditions. Overall, these results suggest that spaceflight may hinder the activation of inflammatory responses in the brain.
