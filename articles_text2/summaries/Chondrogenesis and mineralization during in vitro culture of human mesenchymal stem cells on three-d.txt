The study investigates how the duration of in vitro culture and medium additives influence the chondrogenesis and mineralization of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) cultured on three-dimensional woven poly(É›-caprolactone) scaffolds. Over 45 days, it was found that in chondrogenic conditions, hMSCs could produce cartilaginous tissue with hypertrophic mineralization observable at the scaffold interface by day 45, while osteogenic conditions resulted in limited bone formation. The research highlights the potential for optimizing scaffold and culture conditions to enhance osteochondral tissue engineering strategies for cartilage and bone repair.
