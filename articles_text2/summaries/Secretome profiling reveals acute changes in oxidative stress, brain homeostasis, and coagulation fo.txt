The study investigates the acute physiological changes that occur in astronauts following short-duration spaceflight, specifically by profiling plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew. It found significant alterations in ovarian stress, brain homeostasis, and coagulation markers, with over 70% of some plasma proteins remaining altered even six months post-flight. The research highlights the potential biological disturbances in human health due to spaceflight and aims to develop biomarkers for monitoring astronaut health and guiding countermeasures for future missions.
