The study investigates the effects of simulated microgravity on gene regulation related to immunity and cardiovascular disease using a rat hindlimb unloading model. The research finds that exposure to microgravity induces sex-dependent changes in oxidative stress markers and gene expression profiles associated with inflammation and cardiovascular health. Specifically, the findings suggest that microgravity may lead to an upregulation of immune response pathways while altering the expression of genes involved in oxidative damage and the circadian clock, highlighting potential concerns for long-duration space missions' impacts on astronaut health.
