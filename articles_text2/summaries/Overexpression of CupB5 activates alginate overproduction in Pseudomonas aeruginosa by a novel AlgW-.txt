The study identifies CupB5 as a novel activator of alginate production in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* through an AlgW-dependent mechanism. Overexpression of CupB5 induces a mucoid phenotype by enhancing the cleavage of the anti-sigma factor MucA by the protease AlgW, thereby promoting alginate biosynthesis. The findings indicate that independent peptide signals, including those from CupB5, play a vital role in regulating this process and suggest a complex interplay between various signaling pathways that respond to outer-membrane stress in bacterial settings, particularly significant in the context of cystic fibrosis-related infections.
