The study focuses on the phenotypic characterization of the Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion line SALK_063500, which targets the AT1G05290 gene, making this line homozygous lethal and preventing its establishment. Investigations into the heterozygous line showed a reduced expression of the gene compared to the wild type, as well as abnormal silique development linked to diminished pollen tube germination rates. This research enhances understanding of the role of AT1G05290 in pollen development and provides valuable data for further studies in plant biology.
