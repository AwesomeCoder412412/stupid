The study presents the draft genome sequences of two Fusarium oxysporum isolates obtained from Zinnia hybrida plants that were infected while grown on the International Space Station. F. oxysporum is a significant plant pathogen with implications for both agriculture and human health. The research aims to explore comparative genomics of these strains to understand their adaptation to extreme environments, particularly regarding genes that may confer radiation resistance.
