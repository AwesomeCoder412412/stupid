The study identifies TNO1, a previously uncharacterized protein in Arabidopsis, as a key player in vacuolar trafficking and salt stress tolerance. A mutant lacking TNO1 displays increased sensitivity to salt and osmotic stress, alongside mislocalization of SYP61 and partial secretion of vacuolar proteins, indicating TNO1â€™s role in vesicle fusion processes at the trans-Golgi network. The findings suggest that TNO1 helps maintain TGN structure and is essential for efficient protein trafficking necessary for plant stress responses.
