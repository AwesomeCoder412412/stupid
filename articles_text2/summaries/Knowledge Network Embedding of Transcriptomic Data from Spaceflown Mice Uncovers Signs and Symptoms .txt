The study explores the impact of spaceflight on the physiological changes in mice by utilizing transcriptomic data integrated with a knowledge graph called the Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE). This integration allows for the identification of symptoms and biological alterations akin to terrestrial diseases, uncovering relevant health risks associated with space environments. The findings suggest that knowledge graphs can enhance our understanding of the biological ramifications of space travel, paving the way for future research and potential therapeutic developments for astronauts.
