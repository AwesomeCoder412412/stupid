The study highlights the role of tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps, specifically ACA4 and ACA11, in regulating calcium signaling during pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. It was found that double-knockout mutants for these pumps exhibited disrupted calcium dynamics, including elevated baseline and flg22-induced calcium levels, leading to exaggerated defense responses. The data suggest that these pumps are crucial for maintaining proper calcium homeostasis and signaling during immune responses, and even the relocalization of a plasma membrane calcium pump to the tonoplast could rescue the phenotypes observed in the ACA4/11 knockout plants.
