A new species of bacteria, named *Methylobacterium ajmalii* sp. nov., has been identified from the International Space Station (ISS). Three strains (IF7SW-B2^T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) were isolated and characterized using genomic, phylogenetic, and biochemical analyses, revealing their distinctiveness from other known *Methylobacterium* species. This study highlights the potential of these strains to contribute to plant growth, especially in extraterrestrial environments, and emphasizes the ecological significance of microbial life in closed systems like the ISS.
