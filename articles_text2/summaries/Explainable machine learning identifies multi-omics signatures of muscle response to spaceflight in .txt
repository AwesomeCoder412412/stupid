The study utilizes explainable machine learning to identify multi-omics signatures related to muscle responses in mice subjected to spaceflight, highlighting the adverse effects of microgravity on muscle physiology, particularly muscle atrophy linked to alterations in calcium reuptake mechanisms. By analyzing transcriptomic, proteomic, and methylation data from mouse muscle samples, the QLattice algorithm revealed potential biomarkers like Acyp1 and Rps7, which are correlated with muscle resilience and calcium regulation in the tibialis anterior muscle. These findings may lead to targeted interventions aimed at mitigating muscle loss during space missions.
