This study investigated the impacts of hypothalamic leptin gene therapy on osteopetrosis in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Results showed that their osteopetrotic phenotype is not entirely self-limiting and can be reversed through leptin treatment, as evidenced by the restoration of cartilage replacement with bone and increased bone turnover. The findings highlight leptin's crucial role in bone metabolism, particularly in the context of cartilage resorption and skeletal maturation.
