The article discusses the emerging field of space biomining, which utilizes microbial technologies to extract essential resources like metals, minerals, and water from extraterrestrial bodies such as the Moon, Mars, and asteroids. As humanity seeks to establish self-sufficient settlements in space, the principles of biomining could significantly contribute to in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), enabling sustainable exploration and alleviating reliance on Earth. However, the forensic challenges posed by differing conditions in space—such as gravity, atmosphere, and mineral compositions—necessitate further research and development of specialized techniques and organisms tailored for extraterrestrial environments.
