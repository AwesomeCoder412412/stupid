The Bion-M 1 space mission marked Russia's return to biomedical research in space after 16 years, focusing on understanding the physiological adaptations of mice to long-term microgravity exposure. The mission involved male C57/BL6 mice, which were trained and selected to ensure their well-being and functionality during the 30-day flight. Results indicated that while some mice experienced disadaptation upon returning to Earth, the training program successfully facilitated their adaptation to space conditions, contributing valuable insights for future space biomedical research.
