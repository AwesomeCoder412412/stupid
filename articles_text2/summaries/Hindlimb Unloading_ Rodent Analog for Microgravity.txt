This study utilized single-cell RNA sequencing to examine the carotid and femoral arteries of rats subjected to three months of hindlimb unloading, simulating microgravity. The researchers identified distinct cell populations and gene expression profiles, revealing alterations in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells due to the unloading conditions, including an increase in endothelial cells in the carotid artery and a decrease in smooth muscle cells across both artery types. These findings provide insights into the cellular mechanisms and transcription factors involved in vascular remodeling under conditions resembling long-duration spaceflight, highlighting the potential for increased inflammation and altered intercellular communication during vascular deconditioning.
