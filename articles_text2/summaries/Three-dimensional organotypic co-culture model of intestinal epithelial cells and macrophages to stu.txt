Researchers developed a novel three-dimensional organotypic co-culture model of human intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages to study the colonization patterns of different strains of *Salmonella enterica*. This model, created using a NASA Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor, mimics the complex architecture and functionality of the intestinal environment more accurately than traditional two-dimensional cultures. Findings revealed that incorporating macrophages significantly influenced *Salmonella* colonization, revealing pathovar-specific responses and suggesting potential mechanisms of infection that could inform future therapeutic approaches.
