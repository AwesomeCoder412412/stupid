The study investigates the roles of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in exacerbating lung injuries in a mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), particularly under hyperoxic conditions. Findings revealed that hyperoxia increases the recruitment and activation of iNKT cells, which in turn promotes ferroptosis—an iron-dependent form of cell death—in alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC II), resulting in impaired lung differentiation and function. The use of blocking antibodies against iNKT cell activation showed promise in alleviating lung developmental issues associated with BPD, indicating potential therapeutic targets in managing this condition.
