NASA's GeneLab project aims to collect, curate, and provide access to a diverse array of 'omics' data—genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic—from samples exposed to space conditions, facilitating a systems biology approach to studying biological responses in space. The GeneLab platform has introduced enhancements like a new user-friendly data repository interface, the GeneLab Online Data Entry (GEODE) portal for data submission, and an improved Application Programming Interface (API) for data visualization and multi-dataset analyses. By fostering open science, GeneLab supports collaboration among scientists and engages with educational initiatives to increase the usage of spaceflight data for research and hypothesis generation in space biology.
