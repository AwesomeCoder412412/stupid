High doses of Î³-radiation (6 Gy) lead to significant alterations in bone architecture and cellular dynamics, including a rapid decrease in bone marrow cell density and a transient increase in osteoblast activity, which impacts trabecular bone properties. While a prior low radiation exposure (0.5 mGy) did not mitigate these detrimental effects, bone marrow transplantation successfully restored normal bone turnover and architecture after lethal radiation exposure (9 Gy). The findings highlight the importance of bone marrow health in maintaining bone function following radiation exposure.
