The study investigates the impact of long-duration spaceflight on astronauts through analyzing cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) and RNA (cfRNA) from blood samples taken before, during, and after their missions on the International Space Station (ISS). It specifically highlights an increase in cf-mtDNA and mitochondrial RNA related to stress responses under microgravity conditions, with distinct gene expression changes observed across various tissues. The findings suggest the potential of using liquid biopsies for monitoring astronauts' physiological changes, contributing to our understanding of health risks associated with space travel.
