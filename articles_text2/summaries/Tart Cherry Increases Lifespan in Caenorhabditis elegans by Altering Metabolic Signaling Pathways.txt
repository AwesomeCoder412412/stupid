Research indicates that tart cherry extract (TCE) can significantly extend the lifespan of the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans* by positively influencing metabolic signaling pathways, particularly the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. Daily supplementation with TCE resulted in an increased mean lifespan and upregulated key longevity-related genes such as *daf-16* and *aak-2*, while also enhancing mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress. These findings suggest potential implications for utilizing TCE as a dietary supplement to promote healthy aging in humans due to its antioxidant properties and its mechanisms of action that parallel aging pathways in higher organisms.
