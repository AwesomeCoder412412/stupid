The article outlines critical research gaps in understanding the effects of prolonged spaceflight on human performance and its neural underpinnings, especially as space agencies plan missions to distant destinations like the Moon and Mars. Key areas of focus include the neurobehavioral challenges associated with altered gravity, the importance of considering sex differences in astronaut physiology, and the necessity for integrative omics technologies to study brain and behavioral mechanisms. The authors emphasize the need for personalized countermeasures to mitigate adverse effects on the central nervous system and operational performance, and highlight the potential benefits of such research extending beyond space exploration to address health issues on Earth.
