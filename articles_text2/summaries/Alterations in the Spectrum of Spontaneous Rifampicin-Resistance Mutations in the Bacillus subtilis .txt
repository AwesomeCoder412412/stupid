This study investigated how exposure to the human spaceflight environment affects the mutation frequency and spectrum of rifampicin resistance mutations in the rpoB gene of *Bacillus subtilis*. Samples cultivated on two space missions, BRIC-18 and BRIC-21, and matched ground controls showed no significant differences in growth or mutation frequency; however, novel mutations (Q137R and L489S) were exclusively found in flight samples, suggesting that spaceflight induces unique mutagenic stress on bacteria. The findings highlight the potential for altered microbial behaviors and increased antibiotic resistance in space, raising implications for astronaut health and bacterial evolution in extraterrestrial environments.
