The study investigates the overlapping functions of the Arabidopsis Rab GTPases AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in pollen development and tube growth. Both proteins are essential for normal pollen morphology and germination, as double mutants exhibit defects leading to short siliques due to reduced fertilization and aberrant pollen tubes. Their expression patterns and localization to the Golgi underline their role in vesicle trafficking critical for successful pollen tube elongation, indicating a functional redundancy that cannot be compensated by other Rab family members.
