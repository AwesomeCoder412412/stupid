The EDEN ISS space greenhouse, located in Antarctica, successfully produced over 268 kg of edible biomass during its 2018 operational phase, focusing on cultivating various crops such as lettuce, cucumbers, and tomatoes under controlled conditions. The greenhouse operated from February to November 2018, employing a range of technologies to analyze plant growth, health, and environmental factors in preparation for future space missions. The data collected from this inaugural season will contribute to ongoing research and development for sustainable food production in space environments.
