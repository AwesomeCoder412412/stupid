The study conducted a microbiological and nutritional analysis of red romaine lettuce grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to evaluate the safety and quality of fresh produce for astronauts. Various tests revealed that the levels of bacteria and fungi on the lettuce were generally low and did not contain harmful pathogens, demonstrating the potential of growing safe, fresh food in microgravity conditions. Nutritional analyses showed differences in elemental and antioxidant content compared to ground-grown controls, indicating the need for continued research into optimizing crop production in space for future long-duration missions.
