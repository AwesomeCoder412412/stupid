The draft genome sequences of three Sphingomonas strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) have been assembled to study the effects of microgravity on their characteristics, including bioactive compound production. This research aims to compare these ISS strains with their Earth counterparts to understand their adaptations and potential applications. The findings contribute to ongoing microbial studies in space and provide insights into the microbial diversity associated with the ISS.
