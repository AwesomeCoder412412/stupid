This study investigates how the mechanosensitive protein Piezo1 regulates the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) by influencing their morphological states. Researchers identified three distinct MuSC states—responsive, intermediate, and sensory—based on their protrusions' number and shape, which are dynamically regulated in response to muscle injury. The findings reveal that Piezo1 is crucial for maintaining these morphological states, with pharmacological activation of Piezo1 enhancing MuSC responsiveness and improving regeneration in dystrophic muscle conditions, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for muscle regeneration diseases.
