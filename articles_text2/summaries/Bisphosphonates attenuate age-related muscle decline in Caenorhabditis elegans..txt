The study explores the effects of bisphosphonates, specifically zoledronic acid (ZA), on age-related muscle decline (sarcopenia) using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Findings indicate that low concentrations of ZA (100 nM and 1 ÂµM) significantly extend both lifespan and healthspan by delaying muscle deterioration and improving muscle and mitochondrial integrity. The research suggests that bisphosphonates could serve as a safe and effective treatment option for sarcopenia, potentially translating to improved muscle health in aging populations.
