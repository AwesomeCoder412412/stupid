The study discusses how spatial regulation of a common precursor produced by two distinct genes in the fungus *Aspergillus terreus* results in metabolite diversity. Specifically, two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-like proteins, encoded by the genes *apvA* and *atmelA*, both synthesize the same natural product, aspulvinone E, which is then directed into different metabolic pathways depending on the tissue type (hyphae vs. conidia). This research highlights the role of gene expression specificity in regulating the production of distinct secondary metabolites and adds new insights into the design and reconstruction of biosynthetic pathways in fungi.
