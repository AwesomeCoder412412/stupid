Research on Caenorhabditis elegans aboard the International Space Station revealed that exposure to microgravity significantly reduced neuromuscular strength, demonstrating a 16.6% decline in wild-type worms and a 23% decline in a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The study linked these strength reductions to profound changes in gene expression associated with stress responses, mitochondrial function, and neuronal signaling, underscoring the impact of spaceflight on muscle physiology. The findings suggest potential avenues for countering muscle atrophy in space travel, thereby informing future efforts in space medicine and exploration.
