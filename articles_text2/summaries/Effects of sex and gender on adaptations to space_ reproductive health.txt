Research indicates that spaceflight significantly alters gene expression related to insulin and estrogen signaling in both rodents and humans. Mice studies from the International Space Station highlighted impaired insulin and estrogen receptor activity, particularly in the liver, leading to insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. In humans, astronauts experienced similar disruptions in insulin-related genes and pathways, emphasizing the need for further investigation into these effects, especially regarding metabolic and reproductive health as space exploration advances.
