The study investigates the transcriptomic responses of different muscle types to spaceflight, utilizing mammalian and invertebrate models to enhance understanding of muscle adaptations in microgravity. Results indicate distinct and shared molecular responses between slow-twitch (soleus) and fast-twitch (EDL) muscles, highlighting the role of specific genes in muscle atrophy resistance and metabolic responses. The findings also suggest that invertebrate models like *C. elegans* and *Drosophila melanogaster* may effectively predict muscle responses in mammals during spaceflight, offering valuable insights for countermeasures against muscle deterioration in space.
