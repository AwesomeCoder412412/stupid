The study highlights that spaceflight significantly increases sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium (Ca2+) leak and induces muscle atrophy in the soleus muscle of space-flown mice. Treatment with the antioxidant BuOE does not mitigate these issues, despite enhancing SERCA's affinity for Ca2+. The findings suggest the need for alternative therapeutic approaches targeting SERCA activation or reducing Ca2+ leak to address muscle atrophy and weakness associated with microgravity exposure.
