The study presents the validation of a novel system, WetLab-2, for on-orbit RNA isolation and multiplex quantitative real-time PCR analysis of gene expression aboard the International Space Station (ISS). This facility allows scientists to conduct molecular biology experiments directly in microgravity, addressing previous limitations that required returning samples to Earth for analysis. The results from multiple experiments showed that WetLab-2 effectively isolates RNA and performs RT-qPCR analysis, generating data comparable to Earth-based controls while allowing for real-time adjustments during experimentation.
