The research investigates the virus-like particles (VLPs) produced by two species of parasitoid wasps, *Leptopilina boulardi*, a specialist, and *Leptopilina heterotoma*, a generalist, that attack *Drosophila melanogaster*. Proteomic analyses revealed that the VLPs differ significantly in their protein composition, with *Lh* VLPs exhibiting a mix of eukaryotic and bacterial features, leading the researchers to propose the term "Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles" (MSEVs) to characterize these unique organelles. The study highlights the sophisticated mechanisms wasps utilize to modulate the immune responses of their hosts, incorporating a complex array of immune-s
