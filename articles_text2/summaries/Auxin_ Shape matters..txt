The study investigates the impact of a 2,4-D herbicide formulation (AsiMax 50Â®) on microbial communities in freshwater systems with contrasting turbidity. Results indicate that turbidity influences the herbicide's effects, with greater impacts observed in turbid waters, particularly at lower concentrations where certain phytoplankton populations thrived. Conversely, higher herbicide concentrations reduced phytoplankton diversity and abundance in both clear and turbid systems, highlighting the need for community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological assessments to better understand changes in freshwater ecosystems due to agrochemical exposure.
