A study investigated how spaceflight affects biofilm formation by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, focusing on samples cultured during two Space Shuttle missions. Results showed that spaceflight significantly increased the number and biomass of biofilm cells, leading to the formation of a novel column-and-canopy structure not observed under normal gravity conditions. These findings highlight the implications of altered microbial behavior during space missions, particularly regarding health and safety hazards from biofilms.
