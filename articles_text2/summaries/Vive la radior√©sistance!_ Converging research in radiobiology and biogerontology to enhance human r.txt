The article discusses the convergence of radiobiology and biogerontology to improve human radioresistance for deep space exploration, addressing the hazards posed by cosmic radiation during long missions, such as those to Mars. It outlines potential strategies to enhance radioresistance, including gene therapy, upregulation of DNA repair mechanisms, utilization of radioprotective compounds, metabolic slowdown, and insights from organisms known for their resistance to radiation, such as tardigrades. Ultimately, the authors argue that advancing human radioresistance could also enhance longevity and healthspan for spacefarers, positioning it as a critical aspect of future space missions.
