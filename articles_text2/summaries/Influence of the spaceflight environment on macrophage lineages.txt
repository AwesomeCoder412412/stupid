The article reviews how the spaceflight environment affects macrophage function and lineage, emphasizing the significant alterations in immune responses during and after space missions. Studies indicate changes such as elevated monocyte counts and impaired phagocytic functions, which could impact tissue regeneration and overall astronaut health. Understanding these immune alterations is crucial for developing countermeasures to protect crew members during long-duration space missions and in microgravity settings.
