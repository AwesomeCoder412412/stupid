The study investigates the oligomeric state of the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from *Staphylococcus aureus* and finds that different C-terminal truncations result in pentameric forms in vivo, countering previous crystallization findings of a tetrameric form. Using an in vivo disulfide-trapping assay, the research indicates that the C-terminal region only affects oligomerization when the protein is solubilized in detergent, highlighting that different detergents can influence protein structure. Overall, these findings suggest that the MscL's oligomeric state remains consistent across different conditions, emphasizing the importance of studying membrane proteins in their native environments.
