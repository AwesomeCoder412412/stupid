This study examines the impact of varying gravitational conditions on the growth and morphology of Wolffia globosa, a potential candidate for bioregenerative life support systems in space agriculture. Results indicate that the plant exhibits slight variations in growth rates and morphological traits under different gravity levels, with relative growth rates reduced in simulated microgravity and partial gravity settings, while certain hypergravity conditions showed improved growth performance. The findings suggest that Wolffia globosa can adapt to altered gravitational environments, highlighting its potential for sustainable food production in space missions.
