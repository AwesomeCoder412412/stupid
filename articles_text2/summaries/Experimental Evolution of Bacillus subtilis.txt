The study on Bacillus bacteria focuses on their thermal plasticity and adaptation mechanisms as global temperatures rise due to climate change. Despite their critical ecological roles, the research found that several Bacillus strains showed limited ability to adapt to gradual temperature increases, with only one strain managing to extend its thermal niche by 4 Â°C. Moreover, changes in key genes related to c-di-AMP synthesis were linked to thermal tolerance, highlighting the vulnerabilities of Bacillus species and their potential impact on biogeochemical cycles amid climate change challenges.
