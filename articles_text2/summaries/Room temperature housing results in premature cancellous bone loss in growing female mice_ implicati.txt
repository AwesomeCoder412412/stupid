The study investigates the effects of housing temperature on cancellous bone loss in growing female mice, highlighting that standard room temperature (22°C) housing leads to significant premature cancellous bone loss compared to thermoneutral conditions (32°C). Mice maintained at 32°C demonstrated preserved or increased cancellous bone mass, attributed to higher bone formation rates and lower bone resorption, which were correlated with altered gene expression related to bone metabolism and energy regulation. These findings underscore the importance of environmental factors, such as housing temperature, in preclinical osteoporosis research and suggest that thermoneutral conditions should be utilized to improve the accuracy of studies on age-related bone loss in mice.
