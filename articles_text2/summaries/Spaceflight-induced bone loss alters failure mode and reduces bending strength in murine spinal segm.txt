This study investigates how microgravity during spaceflight affects the mechanical properties of murine spinal segments, highlighting significant reductions in bending strength and alterations in failure modes. Results showed a 17% decrease in bending strength and a 32% reduction in the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve, with failure in flight mice occurring more often within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone rather than at the typical junction seen in controls. These findings suggest that bone loss during spaceflight may contribute to increased intervertebral disc herniation risk in astronauts.
