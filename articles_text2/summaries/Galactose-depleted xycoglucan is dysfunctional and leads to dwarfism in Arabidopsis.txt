In Arabidopsis, mutants lacking the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 produce a dysfunctional form of the polysaccharide xyloglucan, which leads to significant growth defects, including dwarfism and abnormal leaf shapes. The study demonstrates that the presence of this dysfunctional xyloglucan negatively impacts cellular and physiological processes more than a complete absence of xyloglucan would. Restoring normal levels of side chain galactosylation or completely eliminating xyloglucan can reverse these growth impairments, emphasizing the critical role of xyloglucan structure in plant development.
