A study conducted on seven mice exposed to 15 days of microgravity during NASA's STS-131 mission found that microgravity causes adaptive growth in the calvarial bones. Results showed a significant increase in bone volume and a trend towards greater cross-sectional thickness, while tissue mineral density remained unchanged compared to a ground control group. These findings suggest that microgravity-induced fluid shifts can stimulate bone remodeling even in non-weight-bearing bones, highlighting the need for further research on the skeletal effects of long-duration spaceflight.
