The study investigates the effects of chronic skeletal unloading on the vasculature of the rat femur, revealing that prolonged unloading reduces bone and marrow blood flow and elevates vascular resistance during reloading, primarily due to vascular remodeling of the principal nutrient artery (PNA). This remodeling, characterized by decreased arterial diameter and wall thickness, maintains mechanical homeostasis but limits blood flow capacity, potentially leading to ischemic conditions in the bone. The findings underscore the significant impact of physical inactivity on bone perfusion and vascular health, highlighting the need for strategies to counteract these effects during periods of disuse.
