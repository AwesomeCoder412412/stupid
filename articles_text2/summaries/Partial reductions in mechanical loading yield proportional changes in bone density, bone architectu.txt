The study investigates how varying levels of mechanical loading impact bone density, muscle mass, and bone architecture, utilizing a partial weight suspension (PWS) system in mice. Results show that reductions in mechanical loading correlate with proportional declines in these musculoskeletal parameters, with even a 30% reduction in weight bearing leading to significant bone and muscle deterioration. Comparisons between partial loading and complete unloading indicate that the latter causes greater muscle atrophy despite preserving some bone density, suggesting complex interactions and systemic factors at play in musculoskeletal adaptation.
