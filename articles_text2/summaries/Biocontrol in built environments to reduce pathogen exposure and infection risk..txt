The article discusses the application of biocontrol strategies in built environments to mitigate pathogen exposure and reduce infection risks, particularly focusing on the use of beneficial microbial species like Bacillus. It highlights the dual role of these microbes in either competitively excluding pathogens or enhancing the stability of native microbiomes on surfaces. While early studies show potential in reducing antibiotic-resistant infections through probiotic cleaning methods, further research is necessary to understand the mechanisms and optimize these interventions for effective and safe use in healthcare settings.
