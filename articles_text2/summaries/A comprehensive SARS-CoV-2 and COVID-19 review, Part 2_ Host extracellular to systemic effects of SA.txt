Part 2 of the comprehensive review on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 discusses the extensive biological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host systems, emphasizing the viral impact on tissue and organ adaptations and systemic metabolic changes. The review highlights how SARS-CoV-2 alters metabolic pathways, affects humoral factors, stimulates immune responses, and causes adaptations across various organ systems, which in turn contribute to the varied clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including long-term post-acute sequelae (PASC). The authors call for further research to deepen the understanding of these effects and inform future therapeutic strategies.
