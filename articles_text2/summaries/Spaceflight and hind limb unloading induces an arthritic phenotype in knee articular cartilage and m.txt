The study highlights that rodents subjected to spaceflight and hind limb unloading (HLU) develop arthritic changes in knee articular cartilage and menisci, characterized by significant cartilage and meniscal degradation. This degradation occurs at the tibial-femoral cartilage contact point, a critical weight-bearing area, and is associated with elevated levels of catabolic enzymes and decreased glycosaminoglycan content. Recovery of these tissues can be facilitated by exercise during the readaptation phase after reduced weight-bearing, suggesting potential therapeutic implications for managing joint health in both spaceflight and clinical settings.
