The study investigates the role of bone marrow adipocytes in the development of osteopenia following ovariectomy (ovx) in mice, particularly using two groups: wild type (WT) mice and bone marrow adipocyte-deficient kit W/W-v mice. Despite the absence of marrow adipocytes in the kit W/W-v mice, both groups exhibited similar decreases in bone mass and structural changes post-ovx, suggesting that increased marrow fat may not be a necessary factor in the development of osteopenia due to estrogen deficiency. The findings indicate that while there is a reciprocal relationship between bone marrow fat and bone mass, the increase in bone marrow adiposity is not a direct mediator of ovx-induced bone loss.
