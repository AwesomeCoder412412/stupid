This study details the morphology of the utricular otolith organ in the oyster toadfish, *Opsanus tau*, elucidating its sensory capabilities for detecting head orientation and motion relative to gravity. Utilizing various microscopy techniques, the authors describe the structure of the sensory epithelium, hair cell configurations, and the afferent nerve morphology, noting significant regional variations in hair cell distribution and synaptic organization that correlate with functional responsiveness. The findings underscore the similarities in utricular structure across vertebrates while also providing foundational data to assess how the toadfishâ€™s vestibular system adapts to changes in gravitational environments, critical for potential applications in space exploration.
