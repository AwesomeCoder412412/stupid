The Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) is a comprehensive resource designed to aggregate clinical, cellular, and multi-omic data from astronauts participating in various spaceflight missions, including the recent SpaceX Inspiration4. It significantly expands the existing repository of human space omics data, providing insights into the physiological and molecular impacts of space travel, such as changes in cytokine levels, telomere lengths, and gene expression. This resource aims to advance precision aerospace medicine and improve health monitoring for future missions, including those to the Moon and Mars.
