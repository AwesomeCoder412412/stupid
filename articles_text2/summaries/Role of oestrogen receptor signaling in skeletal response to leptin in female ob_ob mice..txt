The study investigates the role of estrogen receptor α (ERα) in longitudinal bone growth in ob/ob mice, which lack leptin, leading to contrasting growth patterns between appendicular (limb) and axial (spine) bones. Results showed that ob/ob mice have shorter femoral lengths and longer spinal lengths compared to wild-type mice, with significant differences in the expression of growth markers and ERα levels in the femoral and spinal growth plates. The findings suggest that leptin deficiency disrupts normal regulatory mechanisms of estrogen receptors in bone growth, indicating a need for further research into their interaction.
