The study involved isolating 94 fungal strains from surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Microbial Tracking-2 experiment and sequencing their genomes. This research aims to evaluate how these fungi adapt to microgravity, assess potential health risks to astronauts, and explore the biotechnological applications of these fungi. The identified strains include various species of Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Rhodotorula, highlighting their potential implications for human health and spacecraft functioning during long-term space missions.
