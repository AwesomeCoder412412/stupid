The article discusses the use of metabolic modeling to identify precision prebiotics capable of specifically increasing the abundance of beneficial bacterial species in microbiomes, particularly focusing on the interaction between two bacteria in the *Caenorhabditis elegans* model system. Researchers predicted and confirmed four prebiotics—L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and γ-aminobutyric acid—that selectively boost the target species *Pseudomonas lurida*. The findings suggest that employing metabolic models is a promising approach for developing targeted microbiome interventions that could support health and treatment strategies.
