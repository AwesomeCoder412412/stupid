This study identifies a rice mutant named COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1), which exhibits root coiling in hydroponic conditions but normal gravitropic growth in soil. The research reveals that CRW1, an F-box protein, regulates ethylene signaling, which, when amplified, disrupts the stabilizing mechanisms of root cap structure and auxin distribution, leading to impaired gravitropism. Mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is shown to antagonize ethylene signaling, restoring normal root growth and demonstrating the significant interplay between mechanical resistance, ethylene signaling, and auxin flow in maintaining root gravitropism.
