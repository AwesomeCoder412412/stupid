A comprehensive multi-omics analysis involving data from 59 astronauts has revealed that mitochondrial stress is a significant biological response to spaceflight, affecting various physiological pathways including energy production and immune functions. The study utilized data from NASA's GeneLab and confirmed findings through the NASA Twin Study, indicating alterations in mitochondrial function and elevated oxidative stress. These insights underscore the need for effective countermeasures to mitigate health risks associated with long-duration space missions, emphasizing mitochondria as central to understanding space biology and astronaut health.
