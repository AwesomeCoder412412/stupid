This study presents the draft genome sequences of six strains of *Bacillus cereus sensu lato* isolated from the International Space Station, specifically from various modules including the U.S. Harmony Node 2, the Japanese Experiment Module, and the Russian Zvezda Module. Sequencing was performed using both Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RSII technologies, revealing high genomic similarity among the isolates and indicating that they do not contain any pathogenic elements distinct to *Bacillus anthracis*. This suggests that these strains represent a novel clade of *Bacillus* within the broader *B. cereus* group, with a genome size estimated between 5.2 to 5.3 Mb.
