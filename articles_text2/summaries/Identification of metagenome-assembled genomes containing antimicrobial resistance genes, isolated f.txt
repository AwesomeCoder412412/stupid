The study identifies 95 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) with antimicrobial resistance genes, sourced from an advanced wastewater treatment facility prior to microfiltration. These genomes serve as a valuable resource for the water treatment community, highlighting the challenges of wastewater reuse and the potential risks associated with antibiotic resistance. Notably, the presence of these MAGs diminished after filtration, indicating effective barrier mechanisms in the treatment process.
