The study investigates the effects of mitochondrial-targeted hydrogen sulfide (mtH₂S) on longevity and health span in *Caenorhabditis elegans*, revealing that small doses of mtH₂S can enhance health span without significantly extending life span when administered during adulthood. The mechanisms underlying these benefits include the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and improved neuromuscular function, which are regulated by specific transcription factors (elt-6 and elt-3). Additionally, adult-onset mtH₂S treatment shows potential as a viable therapeutic approach for promoting healthy aging by targeting mitochondrial health and associated cellular processes.
