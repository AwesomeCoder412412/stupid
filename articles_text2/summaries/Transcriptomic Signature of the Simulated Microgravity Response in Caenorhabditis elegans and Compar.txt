This study investigates the transcriptomic response of the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans* to simulated microgravity, highlighting the persistence of gene expression changes even after the return to ground conditions for up to twelve days. It was found that 75% of the microgravity-induced changes in gene expression remain for at least four days post-return, with significant alterations in longevity-regulating insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling pathways. The research reveals 118 genes commonly differentially expressed in both simulated microgravity and spaceflight conditions, enhancing understanding of the biological effects of microgravity on organisms.
