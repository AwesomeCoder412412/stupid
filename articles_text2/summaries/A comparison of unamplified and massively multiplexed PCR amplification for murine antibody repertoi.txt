The study compared unamplified RNA sequencing of mouse antibody repertoires with commonly used massively multiplexed PCR (mPCR) and found that while amplified datasets yielded higher read counts, they missed detecting a greater number of unique V-gene segments compared to the unamplified data. The research indicated that unamplified sequencing can reliably identify high-frequency CDR3s and a wider range of V-gene segments, suggesting that it represents a valuable alternative to amplification-based methods, especially for capturing the breadth of antibody diversity in the repertoire. Overall, the findings emphasize the potential of unamplified RNA sequencing as a method that minimizes biases and provides a more comprehensive view of immunological responses.
