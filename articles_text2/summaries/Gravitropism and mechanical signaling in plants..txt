The study investigates the role of mechanosensing in regulating root gravitropism in rice, revealing that the mechanosensing pathway opposes ethylene signaling to ensure proper root growth and orientation. A rice mutant named COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) was identified which experiences root coiling in water but normal gravitropic growth in soil, due to mutations affecting ethylene response pathways and resulting in higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The findings indicate that gentle mechanical stress enhances calcium signaling in root tips, thereby inhibiting excessive ethylene signaling and restoring the stabilizing functions necessary for optimal root development.
