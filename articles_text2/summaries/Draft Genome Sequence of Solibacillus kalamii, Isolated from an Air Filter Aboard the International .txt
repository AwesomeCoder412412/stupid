The draft genome sequence of *Solibacillus kalamii*, a bacterium isolated from an air filter aboard the International Space Station (ISS), has been reported, revealing a genome of 3,809,180 base pairs and an estimated G+C content of 38.61%. This research highlights the bacterium's potential adaptations to survive in the ISS's harsh environment, with findings suggesting resistance to various stressors such as vancomycin and hydrogen peroxide. The genome was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform, resulting in a total of 3,814 genes, including those coding for various stress response proteins.
