The Multi-analyte Biochip (MAB) utilizes all-solid-state ion-selective electrodes (ASSISE) for physiological research, demonstrating effective monitoring of ions like H+, Ca2+, and CO32- in complex biological media. Constructed with a conductive polymer transducer (PEDOT), the biochip offers advantages in size, versatility, and multiplexed sensing capabilities, making it suitable for applications in environments such as spaceflight and biological research. Calibration results indicate its reliability in measuring ion concentrations, particularly in monitoring the physiological activity of microalgae like Chlorella vulgaris during photosynthesis.
