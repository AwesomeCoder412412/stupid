The study investigates the physiological and genetic responses of *Streptococcus mutans*, a bacterium associated with dental caries, to simulated microgravity conditions. Findings indicate that the bacteria exhibit increased susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide and significant alterations in gene expression, particularly related to carbohydrate metabolism and stress responses, suggesting that microgravity may enhance the cariogenic potential of *S. mutans* during space missions. This research emphasizes the need to understand how the unique environment of space affects microbial behavior to ensure astronaut oral health on long-duration missions.
