Research on the effects of spaceflight on the olfactory bulb (OB) of mice has revealed that environmental conditions encountered during space travel can significantly impact OB volume, neurogenesis, and cell death. Mice housed in Earth-based modules similar to space conditions displayed greater OB volume and neurogenesis compared to those kept on spacecraft during a space mission, suggesting that the novel environment enhances cell survival and potentially protects against the detrimental effects of spaceflight. However, the anticipated advantages of the enriched environment seem to be negated during actual spaceflight, as evidenced by increased cell death in the spaceflight group, highlighting the complex interplay between space conditions and neurobiological responses.
