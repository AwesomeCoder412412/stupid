This study investigates the effect of simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on the reactivation and lytic replication of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in latently infected cells. The results indicate that CMV viral loads significantly increased in irradiated cells compared to controls, with a notable upregulation of the UL49 gene, suggesting that GCR exposure is a strong contributor to CMV reactivation. The findings underline the potential health risks associated with cosmic radiation for astronauts, emphasizing the need for further research on viral reactivation during long-duration space missions.
