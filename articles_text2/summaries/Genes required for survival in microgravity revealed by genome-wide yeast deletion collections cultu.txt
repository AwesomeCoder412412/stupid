The study examines the effects of microgravity on yeast through a genome-wide deletion collection analyzed during spaceflight, revealing important biological pathways affected by the unique environment. It discovered that spaceflight significantly disrupts processes related to DNA integrity, RNA metabolism, and mitochondrial function, indicating potential parallels with the effects of DNA-damaging agents. These findings could guide future research on cellular responses under stress and inform potential strategies to enhance organismal resilience in space and other extreme environments.
