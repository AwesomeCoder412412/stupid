Nineteen strains from the order Lactobacillales were isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) and a commercial resupply vehicle, and their whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated to characterize these potentially pathogenic bacteria that have adapted to space conditions. The study highlights strains such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Aerococcus urinaeequi, which are of concern due to their antibiotic resistance traits, especially since astronauts can be immunocompromised in microgravity. Understanding the genomic features of these bacteria is critical for developing effective countermeasures to mitigate health risks for astronauts on long-duration space missions.
