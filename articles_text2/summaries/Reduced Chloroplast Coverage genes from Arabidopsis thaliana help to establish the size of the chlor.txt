The study identifies a small gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana, responsible for establishing the size of the chloroplast compartment, which is crucial for plant growth and photosynthesis. The genes, collectively named REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE (REC), produce proteins that play significant roles in regulating chloroplast volume, with the protein REC1 primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The findings suggest that the mechanism governing chloroplast size is linked to mesophyll cell expansion and could potentially be manipulated to enhance crop yields through better photosynthetic efficiency.
