The study investigates the impact of simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on the reactivation and lytic replication of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in latently infected Kasumi-3 cells. The results showed that exposure to various types of radiation, including GCR, significantly increased CMV viral loads compared to control cells, with the highest levels observed around days 12 and 15 post-irradiation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed notable upregulation of the UL49 gene, suggesting a potential mechanism for CMV reactivation due to radiation, highlighting the health risks associated with space travel for astronauts.
