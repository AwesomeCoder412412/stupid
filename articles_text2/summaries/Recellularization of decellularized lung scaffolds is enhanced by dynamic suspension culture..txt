The study explored the recellularization of decellularized lung scaffolds using a dynamic suspension culture method, specifically a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, compared to static culture conditions. Results indicated that the RWV bioreactor significantly enhanced cell attachment, reduced apoptosis, and improved proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (C10) within the scaffolds. The findings suggest that the RWV bioreactor could offer a promising approach for tissue engineering of functional lung tissues, potentially improving extracellular matrix remodeling and cell functionality.
