The newly established International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP) aims to enhance international collaboration and standardization in the field of space life sciences, particularly focusing on the omics data derived from biological experiments in space. This initiative addresses critical challenges arising due to the unique stressors of the space environment, such as microgravity and radiation, which can significantly impact human health and biological processes. By fostering improvements in sample processing and metadata normalization, ISSOP seeks to optimize the extraction of scientific insights and develop effective countermeasures for safe human exploration in deep space.
