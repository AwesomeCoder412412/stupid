This study investigates the effects of spaceflight on the interaction between human intestinal epithelial cells and Salmonella Typhimurium, marking the first dual RNA-sequencing analysis of this kind conducted in space. Results indicate that space conditions altered gene expression in both the host and pathogen, enhancing inflammatory responses and potentially increasing the virulence of Salmonella while suppressing certain metabolic pathways in host cells. These findings underline the heightened infection risks during space missions and the complexity of host-pathogen dynamics in a microgravity environment, emphasizing the need for continued research in this area.
