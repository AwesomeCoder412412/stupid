A study investigated the effects of Ginsenoside Total Saponins (GTSs) on intestinal health in a simulated microgravity environment using a hindlimb suspension rat model. Results indicated that GTSs helped alleviate intestinal injury by reducing inflammation, improving gut microbiota composition, and enhancing the expression of tight junction proteins, which play a crucial role in gut barrier function. The findings suggest that GTSs may have therapeutic potential for maintaining gut health and immune function in astronauts during long-duration spaceflights, with mechanisms likely involving the modulation of microbiota and metabolism.
