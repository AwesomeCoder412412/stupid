The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission marked the first all-civilian crew to travel to low Earth orbit, providing valuable insights into the physiological and cognitive effects of short-duration spaceflight. Research conducted during the mission revealed that while astronauts experienced significant physiological responses, such as ocular misalignment and changes in cardiovascular function, most metrics returned to baseline levels after landing, suggesting minimal health risks associated with short missions. Furthermore, the mission's findings contribute to a growing database on astronaut health, offering a platform for future studies on long-term spaceflight adaptation and the development of monitoring technologies for both private and government missions.
