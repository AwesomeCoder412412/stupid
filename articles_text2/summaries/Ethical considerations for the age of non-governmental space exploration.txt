The rise of non-governmental and commercial space exploration introduces significant ethical, legal, and medical challenges, particularly regarding the selection and safety of space travelers. Current regulations and guidelines primarily designed for government-sponsored astronauts are inadequate for the increasing diversity of participants, including individuals with varying health conditions. As human subjects are utilized in research during these missions, there remains a crucial need for comprehensive regulations that ensure the safety, ethical treatment, and informed consent of all space travelers, while addressing the specific risks and uncertainties presented by the space environment.
