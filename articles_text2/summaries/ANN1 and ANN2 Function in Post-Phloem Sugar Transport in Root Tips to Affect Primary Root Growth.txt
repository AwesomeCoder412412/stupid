The study investigates the roles of annexins ANN1 and ANN2 in post-phloem sugar transport and their impact on primary root growth in Arabidopsis thaliana. The knockout mutants of these annexins exhibit significantly reduced primary root growth and altered root cap structures, which can be partially rescued by exogenous sugars like sucrose, glucose, and fructose. The findings suggest that ANN1 and ANN2 are crucial for facilitating sugar diffusion to root tips and that their absence leads to increased reactive oxygen species and callose accumulation, ultimately impairing root development and affecting the plantâ€™s photosynthetic capacity.
