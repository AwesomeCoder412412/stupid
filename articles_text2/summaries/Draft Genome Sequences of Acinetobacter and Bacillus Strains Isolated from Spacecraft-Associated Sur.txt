The article presents the draft genome sequences of four microbial strains, two from the Bacillus genus (Bacillus horneckiae and Bacillus nealsonii) and two from the Acinetobacter genus (Acinetobacter radioresistens and Acinetobacter proteolyticus), which were isolated from surfaces associated with spacecraft. These strains exhibit notable resistance to stressors like UV radiation and hydrogen peroxide, and their genomes were sequenced using a shotgun approach and analyzed for features related to stress resistance, dormancy, and cellular repair mechanisms. The findings contribute to understanding microbial resilience in space environments and the implications for planetary protection.
