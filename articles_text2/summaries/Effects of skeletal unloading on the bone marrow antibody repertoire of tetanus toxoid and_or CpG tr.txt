The preclinical development of TAK-754, an AAV8-based gene therapy vector designed to treat hemophilia A, shows promising results. In studies involving FVIII knockout mice, TAK-754 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity and demonstrated long-term expression of the FVIII protein, alongside favorable safety and biodistribution profiles. Moreover, the vector exhibited low levels of integration and no evidence of associated adverse effects, supporting its potential for clinical application in hemophilia A patients.
