The "Molecular Muscle Experiment" (MME) aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms of muscle atrophy in the model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans* during spaceflight, which poses unique challenges for biological experimentation. The research highlights critical lessons in hardware development and experimental design, including the necessity for effective gas exchange in culture bags, which impacts organism viability. Through extensive ground trials, the team established optimal conditions for launching and nurturing the organisms in space, providing insights that can enhance future astrobiological studies aboard the International Space Station.
