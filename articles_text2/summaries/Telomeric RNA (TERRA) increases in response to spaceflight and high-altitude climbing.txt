A recent study found that telomeric RNA (TERRA) levels significantly increase in response to conditions such as spaceflight and high-altitude climbing, which expose individuals to radiation. This increase in TERRA is believed to play a crucial role in the DNA damage response, specifically targeting telomeric double-strand breaks. The findings highlight TERRA's potential for encouraging recombination-mediated telomere maintenance, making it a candidate for therapeutic strategies against certain cancers associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres.
