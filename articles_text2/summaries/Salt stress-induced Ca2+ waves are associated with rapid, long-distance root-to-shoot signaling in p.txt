Recent research has uncovered a novel signaling mechanism in plants where Ca2+ waves propagate rapidly from roots to shoots in response to salt stress, facilitating quick, systemic responses to environmental challenges. This long-distance signaling occurs through cortical and endodermal cell layers at speeds up to 400 Âµm/s, suggesting a sophisticated communication network that integrates local stress signals to trigger broader physiological adaptations across the plant. The ion channel TPC1 is critical for this Ca2+ wave propagation, linking it to the plant's overall stress tolerance and molecular responses.
