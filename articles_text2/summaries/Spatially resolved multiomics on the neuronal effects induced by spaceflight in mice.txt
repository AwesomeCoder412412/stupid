This study investigated the effects of spaceflight on the neuronal health of female mice using spatially resolved multiomics techniques, combining single-nucleus multiomics and spatial transcriptomics. The findings revealed significant alterations in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and synaptic transmission, particularly in key brain regions like the cortex and hippocampus, along with increased astrocyte activation and immune dysfunction. The results indicate similarities to neurodegenerative disorders and establish a foundation for further research on central nervous system impairments in future space missions.
