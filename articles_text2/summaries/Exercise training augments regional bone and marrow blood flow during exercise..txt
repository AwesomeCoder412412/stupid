The study investigates how exercise training affects regional blood flow in bone and marrow during physical activity in male Sprague-Dawley rats. It finds that while sedentary rats exhibited increased blood flow in three out of nine bone regions during exercise, exercise-trained rats showed enhanced blood flow in seven out of nine regions, particularly in the femur. This suggests that regular exercise training augments blood flow distribution in the hindlimb, potentially benefiting bone health by promoting better perfusion during physical activity.
