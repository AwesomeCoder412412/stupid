The transcriptomics analysis conducted on skin samples from astronauts and mice exposed to spaceflight revealed significant molecular alterations linked to dermatological issues commonly faced during missions. Key findings indicate changes in genes associated with DNA damage, mitochondrial dysregulation, and skin barrier functionality, suggesting that the unique conditions of spaceflight contribute to increased risks of skin health problems. These insights could inform future research aimed at developing interventions to mitigate these effects and enhance astronaut wellbeing during long-duration space missions.
