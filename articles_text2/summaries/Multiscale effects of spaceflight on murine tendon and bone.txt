The study investigates the effects of spaceflight on murine tendon and bone, focusing particularly on the enthesis, the interface where tendons attach to bone. Mice were sent into space across three missions, and findings revealed that while spaceflight decreased bone carbonate levels and altered collagen fibril sizes in tendons—suggesting increased remodeling—there were no significant changes in the structure or mechanical properties of the enthesis. This indicates that the enthesis may possess resilience against the adverse effects of short-duration spaceflight, despite the nanoscale changes observed.
