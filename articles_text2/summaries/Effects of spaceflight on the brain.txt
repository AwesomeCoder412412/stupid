A parabolic flight experiment examined how human position sense is affected by alterations in gravity, specifically during hypergravity (1.8G), microgravity (0G), and normal gravity (1G). Results indicated that position sense deteriorated in hypergravity, with significant increases in errors during matching and pointing tasks; however, errors decreased during microgravity for these tasks. The repositioning task, on the other hand, showed no significant changes across different gravity conditions, suggesting a possible predominance of central information storage in this method and highlighting distinct underlying mechanisms in measuring position sense.
