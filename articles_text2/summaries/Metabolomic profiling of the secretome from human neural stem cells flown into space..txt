The study investigates the effects of microgravity on human neural stem cells (NSCs) following a three-day space flight to the International Space Station (ISS). Analysis of the secretome revealed that exposure to microgravity increases glycolysis, resulting in elevated levels of pyruvate and glycerate, as well as enhanced catabolism of branched-chain amino acids and glutamine. These metabolic changes indicate heightened energy demands and adaptive responses in NSCs in microgravity, with implications for understanding astronaut health during extended space missions.
