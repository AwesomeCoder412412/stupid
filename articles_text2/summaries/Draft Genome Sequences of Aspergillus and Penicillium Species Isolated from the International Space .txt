The draft whole-genome sequences of 30 fungal strains from the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) and a crew resupply vehicle capsule, have been assembled. This genomic data will aid in understanding the industrial and biotechnological potential of these fungi, which have applications in antibiotic production and bioremediation, while also providing insights into how microgravity and radiation affect microbial evolution and adaptation. The sequences are now available in GenBank, contributing to ongoing microbial tracking studies in space.
