The study investigates the long-term effects of hypothalamic leptin gene therapy on body weight and bone health in skeletally mature female rats. Results showed that leptin gene therapy successfully reduced body weight and abdominal fat without adversely affecting bone mass, density, or turnover markers, contrasting with negative skeletal effects typically seen with other weight loss strategies such as caloric restriction. Overall, the findings suggest that increasing hypothalamic leptin levels can be an effective approach to manage weight without compromising bone health.
