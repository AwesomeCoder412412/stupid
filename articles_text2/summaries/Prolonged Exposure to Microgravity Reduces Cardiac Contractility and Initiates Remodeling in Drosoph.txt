The study investigates the effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity on cardiac function in Drosophila, revealing that it leads to reduced cardiac contractility, structural remodeling, and compromised gene expression related to heart muscle function. Flies reared in microgravity exhibited diminished heart output and proteostasis imbalance, with increased expression of proteasome-related genes and altered myofibrillar organization. These findings suggest that microgravity negatively impacts cardiac health, providing critical insights for understanding potential cardiovascular challenges faced by humans during long-term space missions.
