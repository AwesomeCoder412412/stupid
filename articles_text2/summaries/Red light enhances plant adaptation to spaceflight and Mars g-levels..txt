The study examines how red light can enhance plant adaptation to microgravity and varying gravitational environments, such as those found on Mars, based on experiments conducted during the NASA-ESA Seedling Growth project. It was found that red light can partially reverse negative gene effects induced by microgravity, promoting the re-establishment of cellular functions crucial for plant growth. The findings suggest that light, especially red light, plays a vital role as an environmental cue that can help plants adapt to the harsh conditions of spaceflight and extraterrestrial environments.
