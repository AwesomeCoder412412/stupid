The study focuses on the proteomic analysis of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), revealing significant differences in their proteomes compared to clinical isolates. The ISS strains exhibited increased abundance of proteins related to stress responses, carbohydrate metabolism, and secondary metabolism, which may contribute to higher virulence, particularly under the unique microgravity and radiation conditions of the ISS. These findings underscore the potential adaptations of A. fumigatus to space environments and highlight implications for astronaut health during long-duration space missions.
