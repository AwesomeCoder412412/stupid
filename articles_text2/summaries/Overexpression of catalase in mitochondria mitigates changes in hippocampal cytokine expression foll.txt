This study investigates the impact of isolation and simulated microgravity on cytokine expression in the hippocampus of mice, focusing on the role of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Findings reveal that overexpression of catalase in mitochondria protects against changes in cytokine levels caused by isolation and microgravity, highlighting mitochondrial ROS as a key factor in neuroinflammatory responses to these stressors. The results suggest potential interventions using antioxidants to counteract adverse effects on the central nervous system during long-term space missions and isolation scenarios on Earth.
