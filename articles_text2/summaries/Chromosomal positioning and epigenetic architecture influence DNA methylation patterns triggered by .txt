The study examines how chromosomal positioning and epigenetic architecture affect DNA methylation patterns caused by galactic cosmic radiation (GCR). It identifies that exposure to different types of radiation, particularly high linear energy transfer (LET) particles like iron-56, leads to distinctive and persistent alterations in DNA methylation, while lower LET types, such as silicon-28 and X-ray radiation, result in less permanent changes. Through a comprehensive analysis integrating spatial chromatin organization and histone modifications within the nucleus, the research highlights the critical roles of nuclear architecture and regulatory gene regions in the cellular response to radiation exposure, contributing valuable insights towards mitigating GCR effects on human health during space travel.
