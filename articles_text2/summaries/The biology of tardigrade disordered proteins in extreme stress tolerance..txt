This study investigates the role of cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins from tardigrades in enhancing osmotic stress tolerance in mammalian cells. The research reveals that CAHS proteins, particularly CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8, significantly increase the resilience of HeLa cells to hyperosmotic conditions by promoting reversible aggregation and protecting cell structures. These findings not only contribute to our understanding of the protective mechanisms of anhydrobiosis in tardigrades but also suggest the potential utility of CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants in biomedical applications.
