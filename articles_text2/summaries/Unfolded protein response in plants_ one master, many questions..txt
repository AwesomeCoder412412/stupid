The unfolded protein response (UPR) in plants involves complex signaling mechanisms activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recent studies highlight both conserved and unique features of plant UPR, such as the roles of membrane-tethered transcription factors (bZIPs) and IRE1 isoforms in stress management. However, many fundamental questions remain regarding the activation, regulation, and functional diversification of these pathways, which are essential for improving plant resilience to various environmental stresses.
