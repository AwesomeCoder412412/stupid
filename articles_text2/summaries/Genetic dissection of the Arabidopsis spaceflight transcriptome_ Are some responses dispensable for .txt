This study investigates the genetic responses of Arabidopsis plants during spaceflight, comparing their transcriptomic adaptations to growth on Earth. The research finds significant variability in gene expression among different genotypes, with some responses appearing dispensable for survival and adaptation. Notably, the results suggest that genetic modifications, such as the mutation of the phytochrome D gene, can reduce the metabolic costs of spaceflight adaptation without compromising plant health, indicating potential for optimizing plant performance in space environments through genetic engineering.
