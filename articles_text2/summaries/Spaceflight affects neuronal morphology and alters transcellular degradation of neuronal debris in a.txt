Research on the nematode **Caenorhabditis elegans** reveals that spaceflight has significant effects on neuronal morphology and the degradation of neuronal debris. Specifically, adult C. elegans exposed to microgravity aboard the International Space Station exhibited hyperbranching in PVD and touch receptor neurons, as well as an accumulation of neuronal waste in surrounding tissues, indicating impaired transcellular clearance mechanisms. These findings highlight the potential risks of long-duration spaceflight on neural health and underscore the necessity for further investigation into how such conditions affect neuronal function.
