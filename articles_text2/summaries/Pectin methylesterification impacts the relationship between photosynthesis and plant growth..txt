The study investigates how pectin methylesterification, involving genes CGR2 and CGR3, influences the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth, particularly in Arabidopsis. Enhanced pectin methylesterification allows for increased cell expansion and resource allocation to leaf growth, resulting in larger leaf areas that facilitate higher photosynthesis rates and overall plant growth. Conversely, reduced methylesterification leads to denser, thinner leaves that limit CO2 diffusion, thereby negatively impacting growth by altering carbon partitioning rather than by changing area-based photosynthesis directly.
