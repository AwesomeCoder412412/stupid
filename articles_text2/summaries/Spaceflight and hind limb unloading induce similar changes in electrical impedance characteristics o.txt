This study investigates the effects of spaceflight and hind limb unloading (HLU) on the electrical impedance characteristics of mouse gastrocnemius muscle, using electrical impedance myography (EIM) as a non-invasive assessment tool. Results showed significant reductions in electrical impedance parameters, which correlated with muscle fiber size and bone mineral density, indicating that both spaceflight and HLU induce similar muscle atrophy and potentially bone deterioration. The findings support EIM's potential as a reliable method for monitoring muscle changes due to disuse or microgravity conditions.
