Research on the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana revealed a novel blue-light phototropic response in microgravity conditions, which was masked under normal gravity and showed attenuation at 0.1g. The study highlighted that red-light pretreatment enhanced this blue-light response, demonstrating a complex interaction between phototropic and gravitropic signals in plants, with significant variations observed in root curvature based on light conditions and gravity levels. This research provides new insights into plant behavior in microgravity, important for future space missions and the understanding of plant growth mechanisms.
