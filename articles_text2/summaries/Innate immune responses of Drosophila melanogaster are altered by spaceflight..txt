A study found that the bacterium *Serratia marcescens*, when grown in space or under simulated microgravity conditions, exhibits increased virulence in the fruit fly model (*Drosophila melanogaster*). Specifically, flies infected with space-flown bacteria showed lower survival rates compared to those infected with ground-based controls, although this heightened virulence did not persist after the bacteria were cultured on the ground. The research suggests that microgravity may induce significant physiological changes in pathogens that could pose risks to astronauts by altering the behavior and effectiveness of their immune responses against infections.
