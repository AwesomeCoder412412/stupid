The article reviews the critical role of the actin cytoskeleton in primary root growth, emphasizing its function in cell elongation and response to environmental stimuli such as light and gravity. It highlights the intricate interaction between actin, actin-binding proteins, and plant hormones, particularly auxin, in regulating root development and tropism. Despite advancements in understanding actin's contributions, there remain significant gaps in knowledge regarding the precise mechanisms connecting actin organization to developmental effects, indicating a need for future research to explore this relationship further.
