Recent human stem cell research conducted in microgravity aboard the International Space Station (ISS) has provided significant insights into cell properties that may advance cellular therapies on Earth. Studies have shown that stem cells, including mesenchymal stem cells and neural stem cells, exhibit unique behaviors and enhanced proliferative capabilities in microgravity, potentially allowing for more efficient expansion for therapeutic applications. However, challenges remain in understanding the full implications of these findings, including the effects of microgravity on stem cell differentiation and the safety and feasibility of utilizing space-grown cells for clinical use on Earth.
