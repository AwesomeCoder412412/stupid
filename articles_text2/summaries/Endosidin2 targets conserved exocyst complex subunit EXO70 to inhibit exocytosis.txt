The EXO70 inhibitor Endosidin2 (ES2) impacts the composition of plasma membrane proteins in Arabidopsis roots by targeting the exocyst complex, which is essential for protein trafficking. A quantitative proteomic analysis identified 145 plasma membrane proteins with significantly reduced abundance following ES2 treatment, indicating their role as cargo proteins in exocyst-mediated trafficking. Gene Ontology analysis revealed these proteins' involvement in various biological functions, including cell growth and stress responses, illustrating the exocyst complex's crucial role in maintaining protein dynamics at the plasma membrane during plant growth and environmental adaptations.
