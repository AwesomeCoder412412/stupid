The research detailed in this study investigates the interactions and characteristics of multispecies microbial populations found in potable water aboard the International Space Station (ISS) over several years. By analyzing archived microbial isolates, the authors revealed phenotypic traits, including antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, and potential health risks to astronauts, suggesting that microbial dynamics evolve in response to the unique spaceflight environment. The findings emphasize the importance of longitudinal studies to understand microbial behavior and assess risks associated with microbial presence in closed systems like the ISS, which can have implications for both space exploration and terrestrial water systems.
