The article "Delayed Maturation of Oligodendrocyte Progenitors by Microgravity: Implications for Multiple Sclerosis and Space Flight" by Tran et al., published in Life, contains a correction regarding Figure 10. The authors clarified that the bar graph originally misrepresented transferrin (Tf) as ferritin (Fer), which has since been corrected without affecting the scientific conclusions of the study. The publication has been updated to reflect this change.
