This review discusses the impact of microgravity and space radiation on DNA damage and the cellular DNA damage response during space travel. It highlights that while space radiation can directly damage DNA or produce free radicals, microgravity conditions can exacerbate these effects by impairing DNA repair mechanisms, leading to increased DNA lesions and potential health risks. The findings from various studies reveal conflicting results regarding the interplay between microgravity and radiation on DNA damage and repair processes, indicating the need for further research in actual space environments to resolve these discrepancies.
