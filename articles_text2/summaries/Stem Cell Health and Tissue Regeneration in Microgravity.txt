The review discusses the profound effects of microgravity on cellular biology and its implications for human health, highlighting how this unique environment influences various biological processes. Key findings indicate that microgravity disrupts immune system functions, enhances tissue regeneration, alters cancer cell behavior, and affects organ systems, such as the liver, kidneys, and cardiovascular system. These insights not only enhance our understanding of health risks for astronauts during prolonged space missions but also present opportunities for innovative therapies and regenerative medicine applicable on Earth.
