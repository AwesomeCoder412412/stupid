The review discusses the current and potential applications of lab-on-a-chip (LoC) technologies and biosensors for analyzing extreme environments and space exploration. It highlights the need for compact, efficient, and accurate analytical tools that can function under harsh conditions, such as in space or on extreme planetary surfaces. The authors emphasize that these technologies could significantly enhance in situ monitoring and improve astronaut health surveillance, environmental analysis, and the detection of microbial life in extraterrestrial environments.
