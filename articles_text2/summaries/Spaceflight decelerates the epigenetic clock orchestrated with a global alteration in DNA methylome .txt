A study on mice flown in space for 37 days found that spaceflight induced significant changes in the retina's DNA methylome and transcriptome, leading to a deceleration of the epigenetic clock, indicating younger biological ages for spaceflight mice compared to ground controls. The research revealed a global alteration in DNA methylation patterns and differentially expressed genes associated with retinal diseases, suggesting that spaceflight may impact visual function through alterations in cellular processes linked to oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell proliferation. These findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms behind spaceflight-associated eye disorders in astronauts.
