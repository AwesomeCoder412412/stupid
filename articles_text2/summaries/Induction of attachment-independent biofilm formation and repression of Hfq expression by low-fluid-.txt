The study investigates the effects of low-fluid-shear culture on Staphylococcus aureus, revealing that this environment induces attachment-independent biofilm formation and suppresses virulence characteristics, such as carotenoid production and resistance to oxidative stress. By utilizing rotating-wall vessel bioreactors to simulate physiological conditions, researchers found that S. aureus displayed slower growth, increased antibiotic resistance, and alterations in metabolic pathways, with downregulation of the RNA chaperone Hfq, indicating a conserved response to fluid shear among different bacterial species. These findings contribute to understanding how S. aureus may shift from colonization to infection in varying host environments.
