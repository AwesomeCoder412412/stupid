The study explores how different configurations of the cytoskeleton in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) affect their response to low-intensity vibrations (LIV), specifically focusing on osteogenesis, cell morphology, and stiffness. The researchers found that applying LIV in a horizontal orientation enhances MSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation more effectively than vertical application, particularly at higher frequencies (100 Hz). This indicates that the direction of mechanical signals, modulated by cytoskeletal architecture, plays a critical role in optimizing cellular responses to mechanical stimuli, highlighting the importance of cytoskeletal configuration in enhancing the effectiveness of mechanical stimuli for bone development and health.
