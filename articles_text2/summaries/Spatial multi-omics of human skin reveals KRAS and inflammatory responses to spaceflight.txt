A study on the effects of short-duration spaceflight on human skin, utilizing multi-omics analysis, revealed significant upregulation of genes associated with inflammation and KRAS signaling in skin samples from SpaceX Inspiration4 astronauts. Biopsies taken before and one day after the flight indicated alterations in cellular responses, including disrupted epithelial barriers and altered immune cell activity across various skin regions. These findings enhance our understanding of the skin's biological adaptations to the space environment and may inform countermeasures for future space missions.
