The study investigates the impact of a conditional mutation in the SCD1 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana on the trafficking of PIN proteins, which play a crucial role in auxin transport, gravitropism, and lateral root initiation. The temperature-sensitive allele of SCD1 reveals that at the restrictive temperature of 25Â°C, the mutant exhibits impaired gravitropic growth and auxin transport due to the accumulation of PIN proteins in endomembrane compartments rather than at the plasma membrane. This study demonstrates that the disruption of PIN2 trafficking precedes reductions in auxin transport and developmental defects, highlighting the importance of SCD1 in regulating auxin-related processes in plants.
