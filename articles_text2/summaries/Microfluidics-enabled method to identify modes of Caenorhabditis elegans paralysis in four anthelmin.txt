A microfluidics-enabled method was developed to analyze the modes of paralysis in *Caenorhabditis elegans* under the influence of four distinct anthelmintic drugs: pyrantel, levamisole, tribendimidine, and methyridine. Utilizing real-time imaging and a custom tracking software, the study quantified various behavioral parameters, such as movement patterns and immobilization durations, demonstrating that the drugs exhibited unique effects despite being administered at equipotent concentrations. The findings suggest distinct mechanisms of action among the drugs, highlighting the advantages of this multi-parameter approach for understanding drug resistance and behavior in nematodes, with implications for future drug discovery and screening methodologies.
