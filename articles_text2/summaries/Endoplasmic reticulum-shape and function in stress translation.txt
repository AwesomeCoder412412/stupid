The article discusses the multifaceted role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in stress adaptation within plant cells, emphasizing its importance in organelle communication, protein quality control, and responses to abiotic and biotic stress. The ER serves as a stress sensory organelle, regulating adaptive responses such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) to manage misfolded proteins. Additionally, it highlights the involvement of ER dynamics in immune responses and the implications for agricultural sustainability by enhancing plant resilience to environmental challenges.
