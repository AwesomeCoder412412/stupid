The study investigates the role of the CaV1.2 L-type calcium channel in bone homeostasis within the middle and inner ear, focusing on its influence on osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression, which is crucial for bone remodeling. Using a gain-of-function mutant mouse model, the researchers found that increased Ca2+ signaling via CaV1.2 led to excessive bone formation and reduced osteoclast activity in the auditory ossicles and otic capsule, resulting in structural changes and hearing loss. These findings enhance understanding of the underlying mechanisms of otosclerosis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting the CaV1.2 pathway.
