The study investigates how extended microgravity exposure affects lumbar spine stability in astronauts, highlighting a significant atrophy of the multifidus muscle, which is crucial for spinal support. Analysis of lumbar spine biomechanics before and after six months in space revealed a marked decrease in lumbar lordosis and intersegmental range of motion but no significant changes in disc water content or swelling. These findings suggest that muscle atrophy, rather than disc swelling, is responsible for post-flight spinal flattening and might increase the risk of back pain and injuries upon return to Earth's gravitational forces, particularly for astronauts with pre-existing spinal conditions.
