Research on the Arabidopsis zigzag1 (zig-1) mutant reveals that wortmannin treatment induces vacuole fusion, enhancing amyloplast dynamics and facilitating gravity perception in hypocotyls. The study demonstrates that fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 restrict amyloplast movement, contributing to its agravitropic phenotype; however, wortmannin alleviates this restriction and improves gravitropic responses by promoting vacuole fusion and increasing transvacuolar strands formation. Notably, the findings point to a physical tethering mechanism between amyloplasts and vacuoles, independent of actin or microtubule involvement, highlighting the vacuole's pivotal role in plant gravity sensing.
