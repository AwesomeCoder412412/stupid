The Microbial Tracking-2 (MT-2) project conducted a metagenomics analysis of bacterial and fungal communities on the International Space Station (ISS) over a period of 14 months, analyzing samples from eight surfaces. The study found that Staphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented bacteria and fungi, respectively, indicating a microbiome heavily influenced by the human crew. Additionally, antimicrobial resistance genes were stable over time, suggesting genetic redundancy within the microbial community, and the findings are aimed at ensuring astronaut health and spacecraft integrity for future missions.
