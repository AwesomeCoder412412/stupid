This study investigates the role of gravity in establishing the auxin-gradient system, crucial for the growth orientation of plant roots, using *Arabidopsis thaliana* grown on the International Space Station (ISS). The research reveals that the auxin distribution in the primary roots of plants aboard the ISS was similar to that of control plants on Earth, indicating that this distribution is independent of gravity. However, the distribution of cytokinin in the root tip showed significant differences between the spaceflight and ground control plants, suggesting that cytokinin may be more affected by microgravity and could influence altered root growth patterns observed in space.
