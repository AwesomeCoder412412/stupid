A study using direct RNA sequencing of astronaut blood from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission revealed significant increases in m6A methylation and notable hematopoietic transcriptional changes associated with spaceflight. Analyzing blood samples taken at multiple time points, researchers observed alterations in gene expression linked to erythrocyte regulation, stress responses, and immune system changes. These findings enhance understanding of how space travel impacts human physiology at the molecular level, particularly regarding transcriptional dynamics and RNA modifications.
