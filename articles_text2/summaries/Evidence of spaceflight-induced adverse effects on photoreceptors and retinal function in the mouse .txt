The study investigates the impact of spaceflight on mouse retinal function and photoreceptors, highlighting significant oxidative stress and cell damage following a 35-day mission aboard the ISS. It found that spaceflight led to increased apoptosis and decreased function in the retina, as evidenced by changes in electroretinogram (ERG) responses. An antioxidant treatment using a superoxide dismutase mimic, BuOE, showed some efficacy in reducing oxidative damage, but its overall impact on retinal function was limited, indicating that further exploration is needed to fully understand the implications of spaceflight on eye health.
