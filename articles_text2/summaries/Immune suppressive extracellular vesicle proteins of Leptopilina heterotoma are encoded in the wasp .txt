The study identifies immune suppressive extracellular vesicle proteins (MSEVs) from the wasp *Leptopilina heterotoma*, encoded in the wasp's genome, which play a crucial role in suppressing host immune responses during parasitism. Through proteomic analysis, researchers discovered a total of 407 proteins in the MSEV proteome, with 90% of these having coding regions within the wasp genome. This suggests a potential evolutionary strategy where wasps co-opt their own cellular machinery for effective parasitism, and although the possibility of a viral origin for MSEVs is not entirely ruled out, the evidence supports their classification as cellular entities linked to the wasp's genetic makeup.
