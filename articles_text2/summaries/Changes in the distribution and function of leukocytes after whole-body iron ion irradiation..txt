This study investigates the effects of whole-body iron ion irradiation on leukocyte distribution and function in C57BL/6 mice, focusing on changes that occur 40 days post-irradiation. Findings indicate significant alterations in the immune system, including increased thymus mass and decreased counts of CD8+ T cytotoxic cells, while CD4:CD8 ratios increased. Overall, the results suggest persistent immunological abnormalities and differences in leukocyte behavior depending on tissue compartment, highlighting potential health implications for astronauts during long-term space missions.
