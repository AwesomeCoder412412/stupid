This study presents a microfluidics-integrated device designed to measure the muscle strength of Caenorhabditis elegans during spaceflight on the International Space Station (ISS). The NemaFlex-S device has been optimized for on-orbit use, addressing technical challenges of culturing nematodes across generations and ensuring astronaut safety and efficiency. Following ground validation, this hardware successfully operated on the ISS, generating valuable data that will contribute to understanding the impact of microgravity on muscle physiology.
