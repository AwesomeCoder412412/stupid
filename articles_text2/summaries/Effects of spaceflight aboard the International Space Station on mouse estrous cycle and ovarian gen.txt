This study investigated the effects of a 37-day spaceflight on the estrous cycle and ovarian gene expression of female mice aboard the International Space Station. Results indicated that the estrous cycle stage did not significantly differ between flight and ground control groups, and while ovarian estradiol levels remained unchanged, progesterone concentrations were lower in both habitat and flight mice compared to baseline controls. Overall, the findings suggest that female mice were capable of exhibiting estrous cyclicity during extended microgravity exposure, which has implications for understanding reproductive health in space.
