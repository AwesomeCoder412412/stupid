The study investigates the effects of low-dose charged particle irradiation on oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells, linking it to cognitive impairments. It found that exposure to low doses (<1 Gy) of charged particles results in acute and persistent oxidative stress, which is correlated with reduced cognitive function, specifically impairments in novel object recognition in mice. The research suggests that astronauts may experience heightened risks of cognitive decline due to exposure to space radiation, emphasizing the need for further understanding of the long-term effects of these types of radiation on brain health.
