In a study of *Drosophila* mutants with various alleles of the *kae1* gene, researchers discovered diverse and tissue-specific roles for the essential RNA modification N^6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) in tRNA biogenesis. The study highlighted that while *kae1* is required for t6A synthesis, its absence triggers distinct phenotypes: strongly mitotic tissues, such as imaginal discs, are severely affected, whereas nonproliferating tissues can endure partial loss. This work not only deepens the understanding of t6A's biological significance in metazoans but also opens avenues for further exploration of RNA modifications in development and disease.
