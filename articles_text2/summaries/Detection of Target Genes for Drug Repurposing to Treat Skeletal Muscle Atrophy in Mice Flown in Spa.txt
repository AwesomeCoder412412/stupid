The study investigates the use of machine learning to identify target genes for drug repurposing to treat skeletal muscle atrophy in mice subjected to microgravity during spaceflight. Using link prediction algorithms, key gene regulators associated with muscle atrophy were identified from transcriptomic datasets, and a disease-drug knowledge graph was created to find potential drugs for repurposing. The Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) method proved to be the most effective, offering insights into metabolic and neurodegenerative disease connections and suggesting candidate therapies like nutrients and corticosteroids.
