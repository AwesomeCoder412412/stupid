The study investigates the effects of the SIRT1 activator SRT2104 on mitochondrial function and muscle mass loss in hindlimb unloaded rats, a model simulating the muscle atrophy experienced in microgravity. Results indicate that SRT2104 treatment preserved mitochondrial function in unloaded skeletal muscle, evidenced by reduced proton leak and maintained electron transfer capacity in the gastrocnemius muscle. Additionally, SRT2104 treatment mitigated muscle mass loss, suggesting its potential as a countermeasure to combat muscle atrophy during spaceflight.
