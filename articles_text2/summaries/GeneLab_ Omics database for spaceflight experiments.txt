The NASA GeneLab RNA-seq consensus pipeline has been developed to standardize the processing of short-read RNA sequencing data from spaceflight experiments, addressing the challenges of data variability across different studies. This pipeline encompasses multiple steps including quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification, resulting in the identification of differentially expressed genes, with the aim of promoting consistency and reproducibility in data analysis. Resulting datasets and detailed processing information are publicly available through the GeneLab database, facilitating access for researchers and enhancing the understanding of how spaceflight conditions affect gene expression in various organisms.
