The study investigated the effects of lunar gravity (1/6 g) on the salivary glands of mice, specifically focusing on the upregulation of the Amy1 gene, which encodes salivary amylase. Findings revealed that exposure to lunar gravity significantly increased the expression of genes associated with salivary secretion, including Amy1, Vamp8 (involved in vesicle transport), and several small G proteins (Rap and Rab families), thus suggesting enhanced salivary amylase secretion mechanisms under reduced gravity conditions. The research highlights the potential implications of lunar gravity on salivary gland function and stress regulation, which may inform future health monitoring for extended space missions.
