The study investigates the effects of high-energy proton radiation on ocular tissues, specifically the retina and optic nerve head (ONH), in male mice. It examines parameters such as apoptosis and oxidative stress following both a single acute dose and fractionated doses, finding significant increases in apoptotic cell density and markers of oxidative damage (4-HNE) in irradiated tissues. The research highlights the implications of radiation exposure on blood-retina barrier integrity, noting differences in cellular responses between single and fractionated doses, which could inform future countermeasures for astronaut health during long-duration space missions.
