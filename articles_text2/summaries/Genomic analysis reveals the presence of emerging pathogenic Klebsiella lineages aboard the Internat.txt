Genomic analysis has identified emerging pathogenic lineages of the bacterium *Klebsiella* aboard the International Space Station (ISS), with notable findings including strains of *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Klebsiella aerogenes*, and *Klebsiella quasipneumoniae*. The study highlights the genetic traits of these isolates, such as antimicrobial resistance and virulence factors, particularly focusing on *K. quasipneumoniae* ST138 and the high-risk *K. pneumoniae* ST101 lineage, which are of clinical concern due to their adaptability and potential risks to crew members, especially those immunocompromised. The persistence of these strains in the unique microgravity environment of the ISS emphasizes the
