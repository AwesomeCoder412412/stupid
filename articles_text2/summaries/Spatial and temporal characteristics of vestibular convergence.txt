The study investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of converging inputs from semicircular canals and otolith organs onto non-eye movement (NEM) neurons in the vestibular nuclear complex of pigeons. It reveals that while the inputs are spatially aligned and similarly sensitive, they are often temporally out of phase, suggesting complex integration mechanisms within these neurons. The findings indicate that conventional linear summation models cannot accurately predict the net responses during combined canal and otolith stimulation, highlighting the need for further exploration of the underlying neural processing in avian vestibular systems.
