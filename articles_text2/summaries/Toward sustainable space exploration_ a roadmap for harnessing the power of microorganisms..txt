The article discusses the importance of sustainable approaches to space exploration, particularly through the use of microbial biotechnologies. It asserts that harnessing microorganisms can aid in establishing in situ resource utilization and closed-loop systems for long-duration missions, thus mitigating reliance on Earth resources and addressing ethical concerns about space waste and environmental preservation. The proposed microbial technologies not only enhance sustainability in space but are also applicable to solving terrestrial environmental issues, supporting broader United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
