The study characterizes the naive murine antibody repertoire using unamplified high-throughput sequencing of splenic tissue from adult female C57BL/6J mice, revealing over 90,000 heavy-chain and 135,000 light-chain immunoglobulin sequences. The findings demonstrate uniform usage of V-, D-, and J-gene segments among the different mouse pools, while CDR3 amino acid sequences exhibited considerable diversity, indicating robust combinatorial diversity in the B-cell population. Additionally, the study highlights variations in gene segment usage based on chromosomal location and establishes a foundational dataset for future research into antibody repertoire dynamics, particularly in response to antigen exposure.
