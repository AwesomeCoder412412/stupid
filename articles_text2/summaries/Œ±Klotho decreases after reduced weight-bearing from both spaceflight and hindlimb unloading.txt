The study investigates the effects of reduced weight-bearing conditions, specifically from spaceflight and hindlimb unloading, on circulating levels of αKlotho, a protein important for calcium-phosphorus balance and bone health. Findings indicate that plasma αKlotho levels significantly decrease under both conditions but can be partially or fully recovered through exercise upon returning to weight-bearing. This suggests a potential link between exercise, weight-bearing activities, and αKlotho levels, highlighting its importance as a biomarker for bone and kidney health, particularly in the context of space missions.
