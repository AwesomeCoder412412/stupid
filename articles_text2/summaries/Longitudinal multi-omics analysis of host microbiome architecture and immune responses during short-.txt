The study conducted a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of the human microbiome and immune responses of four individuals during the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission, a short-term spaceflight. Over six months, researchers collected data from various body sites before, during, and after the three-day spaceflight, revealing significant and primarily transient changes in microbial communities, particularly in the oral and skin microbiomes. Notably, increased presence of specific bacterial and viral taxa correlated with changes in immune cell gene expression, emphasizing the complex interplay between the host's microbiome and immune response during space travel.
