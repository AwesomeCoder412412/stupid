In a study conducted aboard the International Space Station, researchers discovered a novel positive phototropic response in the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana when exposed to blue light in microgravity, which was significantly reduced at low gravity levels (0.1g) and absent at higher gravity levels. This response was enhanced by a one-hour red-light pretreatment, and a similar positive response to red light was also observed, though both were affected by the magnitude of gravity. The findings highlight the complex interplay between light and gravity in influencing plant growth and may provide insights into plant behavior in extraterrestrial environments.
