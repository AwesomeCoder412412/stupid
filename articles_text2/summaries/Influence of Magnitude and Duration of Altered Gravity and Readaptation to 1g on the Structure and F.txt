The study examines the effects of altered gravity on the utricle structure and function in toadfish, specifically focusing on how their vestibular afferents respond to varying gravitational forces through centrifugation. It was found that the utricular afferent sensitivity initially increases significantly after a few days in hypergravity (2.24 g), followed by a gradual decrease in sensitivity with prolonged exposure, mirroring adaptive mechanisms observed in microgravity scenarios. The research emphasizes the neural adaptation to altered gravitational conditions, with implications for understanding vestibular function and readaptation processes in varying environments.
