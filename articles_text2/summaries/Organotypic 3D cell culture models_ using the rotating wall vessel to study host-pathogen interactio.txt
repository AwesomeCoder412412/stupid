The article discusses the development of 3D oral and cervical tissue models to study host-pathogen interactions, particularly focusing on human papillomavirus (HPV). Two key methods are highlighted: organotypic raft cultures and rotating wall vessel bioreactor systems, which allow for the generation of physiologically relevant 3D tissues that can mimic the morphology and biochemical conditions of in vivo tissues. These models facilitate the investigation of the HPV life cycle and interactions with host cells, providing valuable insights for cancer research and pathogen studies.
