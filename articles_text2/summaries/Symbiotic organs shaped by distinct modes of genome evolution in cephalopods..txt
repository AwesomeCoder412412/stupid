The study investigates the genomes of the Hawaiian bobtail squid, *Euprymna scolopes*, revealing significant genomic reorganizations crucial for the evolution of its specialized symbiotic organs: the light organ (LO) and the accessory nidamental gland (ANG). The LO shows evolutionary links to eye genes through subfunctionalization, while the ANG has a unique set of species-specific orphan genes, suggesting different evolutionary mechanisms for these tissues. This research provides insights into the genomic evolution of symbiotic organs, differentiating between organ-specific gene expansion and taxon-specific innovations, furthering our understanding of host-microbe interactions in cephalopods.
