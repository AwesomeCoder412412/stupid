The study investigates the mechanisms by which Bacillus subtilis spores resist lethal ionizing radiation, identifying DNA repair processes and core components as crucial for their survival. Key findings indicate that the spore's DNA repair via nonhomologous end joining and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases are significantly more important for radiation resistance than oxidative stress responses or detoxification mechanisms. Additionally, α/β-type small acid-soluble proteins enhance spore DNA protection, while γ-type SASP has a negligible role in this resistance.
