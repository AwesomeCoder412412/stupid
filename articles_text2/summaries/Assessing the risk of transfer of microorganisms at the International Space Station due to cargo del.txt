This study evaluates the risk of microorganism transfer to the International Space Station (ISS) from commercial resupply vehicles (CRVs) by comparing their microbiomes. The findings indicate that CRVs maintained rigorous cleaning protocols, resulting in a significantly lower microbial burden than the ISS. Analysis revealed that while some overlapping species existed between CRVs and the ISS, most microorganisms detected in the CRVs were not found on the ISS, suggesting minimal risk of forward contamination from CRV transport.
