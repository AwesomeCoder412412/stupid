The study investigates the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the desiccation process of the tardigrade *Paramacrobiotus spatialis* during anhydrobiosis, a state of suspended metabolism in response to water loss. It was found that ROS production significantly increases with the duration of desiccation, indicating oxidative stress during this process. The research also evaluated the involvement of various bioprotectants, particularly antioxidant enzymes and aquaporins, using RNA interference to disrupt gene functions, revealing that specific genes, such as glutathione peroxidase, are crucial for survival and recovery during rehydration, highlighting the complex interplay of mechanisms that support desiccation tolerance in tardigrades.
