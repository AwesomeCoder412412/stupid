The study focuses on the role of the REGULATOR OF BULB BIOGENESIS1 (RBB1) gene in vacuole bulb formation in Arabidopsis, revealing that RBB1 regulates the morphology of vacuoles and is linked to the formation of transvacuolar strands (TVS). Mutants with a defective RBB1 gene (rbb1-1) exhibit increased bulb presence and reduced TVS, suggesting that bulbs form when TVS fail to elongate. RBB1 encodes a large, plant-specific protein of unknown function and is crucial for maintaining vacuole structure and dynamics.
