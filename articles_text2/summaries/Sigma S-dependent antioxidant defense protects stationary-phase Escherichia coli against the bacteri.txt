The research highlights the role of σ^S-dependent antioxidant defense in protecting stationary-phase *Escherichia coli* from the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin (Gm). It was found that deletion of the σ^S gene increases sensitivity to Gm due to compromised antioxidant systems, leading to higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress. The study suggests that targeting the antioxidant defenses may enhance the efficacy of gentamicin against stationary-phase bacteria, which are vital in disease contexts.
