The research highlights a mechanism through which plants propagate systemic calcium waves in response to salt stress, primarily involving the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-assisted calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) facilitated by the NADPH oxidase AtRBOHD and the TWO PORE CHANNEL1 (TPC1). Using mathematical modeling alongside experimental investigations, the study concludes that while calcium diffusion alone is insufficient to explain observed wave speeds, ROS plays a critical role in enhancing signal propagation. The findings suggest a complex interplay between ROS and calcium signaling in plants, important for stress responses.
