The article outlines a study validating a new rodent experimental system designed to assess the health impacts of long-duration space habitation. The research involved launching female mice into microgravity aboard the International Space Station (ISS), where they were monitored for health and subjected to tissue analysis after varying durations in space. Results indicated that the mice showed no significant health detriments, with increased activity levels in microgravity and some organ weight changes, thus establishing this system as a viable method for conducting long-term biological experiments in space and facilitating on-orbit sample recovery.
