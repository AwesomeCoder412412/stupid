NASA GeneLab's microarray studies on Mus musculus and Homo sapiens under altered gravitational conditions reveal significant physiological changes resulting from spaceflight, impacting various systems such as musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune responses. The research highlights that while there is some overlap in differentially expressed genes across species exposed to microgravity, overall, the genomic responses between mice and humans appear limited, likely due to the scarcity of human data. The findings underscore the importance of further studies to identify gene signatures reflective of human responses to microgravity, which is crucial for maintaining astronaut health during deep space missions.
