Research conducted on mice subjected to spaceflight examined how oxidative stress impacts gene expression in various brain regions and assessed the ameliorative effects of the antioxidant BuOE. The study identified significant differential gene expression linked to spaceflight, particularly in the hippocampal regions, which may elevate the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Treatment with BuOE attenuated some of these transcriptional changes, suggesting potential for protecting against oxidative stress-induced brain damage associated with space travel.
