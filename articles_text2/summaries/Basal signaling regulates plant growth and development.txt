The study analyzed the proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinase (PERK) gene family in Brassica napus, identifying 50 genes and exploring their evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and roles in clubroot disease resistance. Findings indicate significant gene diversification, potential functional specializations, and expression patterns influenced by hormone signaling and stress responses. Notably, specific PERK genes were downregulated in response to Plasmodiophora brassicae infection, suggesting their involvement in disease susceptibility and indicating possible targets for crop improvement strategies against clubroot disease.
