Research has demonstrated that inhibiting specific microRNAs (miRNAs)—miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p—can effectively mitigate the cellular damage caused by space radiation, particularly in human microvascular endothelial cells exposed to Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR). The study found that treatment with antagomirs targeting these miRNAs led to reduced inflammation, DNA double-strand breaks, and improved mitochondrial function, suggesting their potential as countermeasure strategies for astronauts during long space missions to maintain health and prevent cardiovascular issues. This research provides a promising avenue for developing protective interventions against radiation-induced damage in space environments.
