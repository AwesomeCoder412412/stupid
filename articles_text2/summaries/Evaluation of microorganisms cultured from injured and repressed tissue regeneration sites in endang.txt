The study investigates microorganisms cultured from injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites in endangered Ozark Hellbender salamanders, aiming to uncover potential causes of their declining health and population. While many identified bacteria and fungi are common environmental organisms, several were identified as opportunistic pathogens, particularly associated with the injured tissues. These findings suggest that the observed abnormalities and lack of regeneration in the hellbenders may be influenced by multiple factors, including disease and habitat degradation, revealing the complexity of microbial interactions in this endangered species.
