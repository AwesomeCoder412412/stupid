The study investigates the impact of colonization by the yeast *Candida albicans* on ethanol consumption and behavioral responses in mice. Findings suggest that *C. albicans* colonization leads to lower ethanol preference and consumption, which is associated with elevated serum levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and alterations in the dopamine receptor expression in the dorsal striatum. The results indicate that PGE2 signaling plays a critical role in modulating ethanol-related behaviors, highlighting the influence of the gut microbiome on alcohol use disorder (AUD) and related phenotypes.
