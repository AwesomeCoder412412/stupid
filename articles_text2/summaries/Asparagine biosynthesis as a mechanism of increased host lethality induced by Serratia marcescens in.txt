This study investigates the virulence of the opportunistic bacterium **Serratia marcescens** in simulated microgravity (LSMMG) conditions, revealing that LSMMG enhances asparagine biosynthesis and uptake, which correlates with increased host mortality in the **Drosophila melanogaster** model. Specifically, the overexpression of the asparagine synthetase gene **asnB** was linked to the bacteria's ability to exploit nutrients more efficiently under microgravity, allowing it to outcompete the host's immune response. Additionally, the application of L-asparaginase was shown to reduce the increased lethality associated with LSMMG-exposed bacteria, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for managing infections in microgravity
