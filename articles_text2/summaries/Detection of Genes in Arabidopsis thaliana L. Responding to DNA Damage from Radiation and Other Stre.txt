This study investigates the gene regulatory responses of *Arabidopsis thaliana* to DNA damage from radiation and other stressors in spaceflight environments. Using data from GeneLab, researchers performed network analyses to identify specific genes involved in DNA damage responses, highlighting both radiation-induced and non-radiation-induced gene interactions. Key findings include the identification of various hub genes that play significant roles in cellular stress responses, DNA repair, and pigment biosynthesis under different radiation conditions, indicating the plant's adaptive mechanisms during spaceflight.
