The study investigates sex differences in muscle health in male and female rats subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity environments. Results indicate that female rats exhibited greater muscle atrophy and strength loss compared to males, irrespective of the presence of sex steroid hormones, suggesting inherent biological factors contribute to these differences. These findings underscore the need for tailored interventions to protect female astronauts' musculoskeletal health during space missions.
