The article discusses the significance of genetic diversity, particularly in Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes, for the resilience and adaptation of natural populations to changing environments and emerging diseases. It highlights patterns of MHC diversity across geographic locations and time, noting that genetic variation tends to decrease at the edges of species ranges and in regions facing habitat fragmentation and climate change. The authors advocate for integrating immunogenetic diversity data with environmental and parasite information to enhance understanding and conservation strategies for wildlife populations amidst ongoing challenges posed by climate change and infectious diseases.
