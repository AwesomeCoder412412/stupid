A study on *Arabidopsis thaliana* seedlings during spaceflight revealed alterations in gene expression related to cell wall organization and stress responses. Comparative transcriptomic analyses conducted aboard the Space Shuttle during the STS-131 mission indicated significant changes in the expression of genes involved in hypoxia and heat shock responses, as well as differences in cell wall components when compared to ground controls. Common findings across multiple research groups included the downregulation of water stress response genes and differential regulation of genes associated with cell wall remodeling, highlighting how spaceflight conditions impact plant development.
