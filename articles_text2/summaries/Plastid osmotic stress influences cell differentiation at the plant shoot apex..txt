The study investigates how plastid osmotic stress affects cell differentiation at the shoot apex of *Arabidopsis thaliana*. It focuses on a mutant with constitutive plastid osmotic stress, showing that such stress leads to significant changes in cytokinin levels, resulting in excess callus production. Mechanistic details reveal involvement of the cytokinin/WUSCHEL signaling pathway, elevated reactive oxygen species, and factors like ABA biosynthesis, which collectively influence the balance between proliferation and differentiation in plant development.
