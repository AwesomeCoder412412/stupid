This study investigates the effects of microgravity on vascular remodeling and gene expression in the calvaria of mice subjected to spaceflight using two missions: STS-131 (15 days) and BION-M1 (30 days). It found that spaceflight led to a significant increase in capillarization and changes in vessel diameter in the calvaria, along with substantial upregulation of pro-angiogenic (VEGFA) and pro-osteogenic (BMP-2) genes in the STS-131 group. These findings suggest that the calvarial bones respond to microgravity-induced fluid shifts and highlight the importance of studying vascular and osteogenic adaptations for future long-duration space missions.
