The study titled "Cosmic kidney disease" investigates renal dysfunction caused by spaceflight, utilizing a multi-omics approach that includes biomolecular, clinical, and morphological analyses. Key findings reveal that space exposure leads to changes in renal transporter phosphorylation, nephron remodeling, and kidney damage associated with galactic cosmic radiation, which may increase the risk for kidney stone formation among astronauts. This research highlights the urgent need to examine kidney health during long-duration space missions as missions to Mars and beyond approach.
