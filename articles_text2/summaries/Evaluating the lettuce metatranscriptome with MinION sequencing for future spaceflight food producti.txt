This study explores the use of MinION sequencing to evaluate the metatranscriptome of the microbiome associated with red romaine lettuce, which could enhance food production in spaceflight. By developing a methodology to enrich microbial RNA and analyze transcriptional activities, researchers demonstrate that it is feasible to monitor microbial health on crops during long-duration space missions. The findings indicate significant diversity in the microbial community, highlighting specific bacteria and fungi that could impact plant health and food safety, thus informing future agricultural practices in space.
