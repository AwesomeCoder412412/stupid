The study investigates how simulated microgravity affects the proteome and secretome of the polyextremotolerant black fungus *Knufia chersonesos*. Through this research, it was found that microgravity exposure led to differential protein expression mainly related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, with notable variations between wild-type and non-melanized mutant strains, though both strains maintained their growth and viability. The findings contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms that may aid extremophiles' survival in extreme environments, including potential astrobiological applications.
