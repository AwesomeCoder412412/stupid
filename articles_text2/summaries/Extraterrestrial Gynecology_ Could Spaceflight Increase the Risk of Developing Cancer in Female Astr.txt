The review examines the potential increase in cancer risk, specifically gynecological cancers, for female astronauts due to exposure to microgravity and radiation during spaceflight. Historically, women have been limited in their time spent in space due to the higher incidence of radiation-induced cancers, particularly breast, ovarian, and thyroid cancers. The authors emphasize the need for further research on the impacts of space environments on female reproductive health and propose that understanding these risks is crucial for future exploration missions and the safety of female astronauts.
