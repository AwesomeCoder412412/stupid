Research on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms during spaceflight revealed that biofilm formation is significantly reduced on lubricant-impregnated surfaces compared to stainless steel surfaces. The study found that biofilms exhibited less biomass, thickness, and area coverage in microgravity, and the lubricant-impregnated surfaces not only inhibited biofilm formation overall but did so more effectively in space than on Earth. This suggests that such surfaces could be an effective strategy for controlling biofilm growth in spacecraft environments.
