This study investigates the role of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in the transcriptional reprogramming of *Arabidopsis thaliana* during spaceflight, focusing on its effects on plant growth under microgravity conditions. Using transcriptome profiling of wild-type and UPR-defective mutants aboard the SpaceX CRS12 mission, the researchers found that spaceflight induced significant changes in gene expression that were largely independent of UPR regulation, suggesting that alternative signaling pathways may compensate for UPR loss in space. The results indicate that while the UPR plays a minor role in regulating gene expression in space, understanding these mechanisms can facilitate the development of resilience in plants for sustainable growth in extraterrestrial environments.
