The study investigates the effects of a 60-minute pulse of hypergravity (HG) mechanostimulation on the transcriptomic responses of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and embryoid bodies (EBs) during early development. Findings show that while both ESCs and EBs exhibit limited shifts in transcriptional profiles due to the HG pulse, EBs reveal more pronounced changes, particularly in pathways related to multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, and DNA damage repair. Importantly, the HG pulse appears to support the maintenance of stemness and influence cell fate decisions towards differentiation in EBs, suggesting that gravity mechanostimulation can modulate developmental processes at the cellular level.
