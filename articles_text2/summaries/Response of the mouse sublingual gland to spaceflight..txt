The study examined the effects of spaceflight on the ultrastructure and protein expression of mouse sublingual glands following missions on the space shuttles Discovery and Atlantis. While no significant structural changes were observed in the glands between flight and ground control mice, the expression of specific proteins like parotid secretory protein (PSP) and mucin exhibited variability, suggesting that spaceflight has differential impacts on salivary gland responses. Overall, the findings indicate that microgravity alters protein expression without major morphological changes, highlighting the need for further research to understand these effects on astronaut health.
