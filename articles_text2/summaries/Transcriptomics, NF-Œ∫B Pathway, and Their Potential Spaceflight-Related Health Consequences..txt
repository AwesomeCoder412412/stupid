The review explores the impact of spaceflight on the NF-κB signaling pathway and its implications for health, highlighting how microgravity and space radiation can lead to various health risks such as immune dysfunction, bone loss, muscle atrophy, and central nervous system issues. Transcriptomics studies show that NF-κB is commonly affected in different cell types and organs, exhibiting altered activation or inhibition based on the cellular context, which may exacerbate spaceflight-related health problems. The authors emphasize the need for further research on the NF-κB pathway to develop effective countermeasures to promote astronaut health during long-duration missions.
