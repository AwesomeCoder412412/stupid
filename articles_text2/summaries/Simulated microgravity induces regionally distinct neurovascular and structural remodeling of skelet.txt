The study investigates the effects of simulated microgravity through hindlimb unloading (HU) on the structural and functional adaptations of skeletal muscle and skin arteries in rats. Findings reveal that HU induces opposing changes in forelimb and hindlimb arteries, with increased lumen diameter and contractility in forelimb arteries, while hindlimb arteries exhibit reduced contractility and sympathetic innervation density. The results underscore the complexity of vascular responses to microgravity, which differ significantly between anatomical regions and vascular types, potentially influencing human reactions to similar conditions during spaceflight.
