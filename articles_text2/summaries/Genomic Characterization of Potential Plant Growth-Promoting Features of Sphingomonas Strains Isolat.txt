The study characterizes Sphingomonas strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) and examines their potential plant growth-promoting features, including the production of phytohormones like indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and resistance to abiotic stresses. Genomic analysis revealed high similarity between the ISS strains (Sphingomonas sanguinis and Sphingomonas paucimobilis) and other known strains, as well as the presence of several genes associated with plant growth promotion and stress tolerance. These findings suggest that such microorganisms could play a crucial role in supporting plant growth in future space missions, contributing to self-sustainable life support systems.
