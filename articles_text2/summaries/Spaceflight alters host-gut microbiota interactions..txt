The study explores how spaceflight impacts gut microbiota and host gene expression in mice, revealing significant alterations in microbial composition and host metabolism during space missions. Notable findings include changes in bacteria that metabolize bile and fatty acids, alongside dysregulation of host lipid and glucose metabolism associated with immune suppression. This suggests that interactions between gut microbiota and host systems could contribute to health risks for astronauts on long-duration missions.
