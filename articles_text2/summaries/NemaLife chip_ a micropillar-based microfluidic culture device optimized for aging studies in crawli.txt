The NemaLife chip is a novel microfluidic culture device designed for long-term studies on aging in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It features an optimized micropillar structure that enables the worms to crawl naturally, thereby mimicking their behavior on agar while eliminating manual transfers and reducing stress from swimming in liquid environments. The device allows for easy monitoring of lifespan and health parameters, and its efficacy has been validated through analyses of standard aging mutants and RNAi experiments, highlighting its potential for advancing research in healthy aging.
