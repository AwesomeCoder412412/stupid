The study investigates the effects of root skewing-associated genes SPR1 and SKU5 on the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana during spaceflight, highlighting how these genes influence root behavior and gene expression under microgravity conditions. Results revealed that the spr1 mutant exhibited less intensive gene expression changes compared to its wild type, suggesting it may adapt more efficiently to spaceflight. Conversely, the sku5 mutant showed a dramatic increase in gene expression related to stress responses, indicating that SKU5 plays a significant role in regulating physiological adaptations to the stress of spaceflight. Overall, the findings suggest distinct mechanisms underlying spaceflight responses between the two skewing pathways.
