The study investigates the effects of microgravity from a 13-day spaceflight on the vasoconstrictor and mechanical properties of cerebral arteries in mice. Results showed significant reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness, along with increased arterial diameter and distensibility in the spaceflight group compared to ground controls. These changes suggest that microgravity may enhance cerebral blood flow, potentially leading to increased intracranial pressure and visual impairments in astronauts.
