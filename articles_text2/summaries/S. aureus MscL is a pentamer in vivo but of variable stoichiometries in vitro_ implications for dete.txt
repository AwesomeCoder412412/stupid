The study investigates the oligomeric state of the S. aureus MscL mechanosensitive channel, revealing that it is primarily a pentamer in vivo, despite reports of variable stoichiometries when analyzed in vitro, particularly with different detergents. While the channel appears as a tetramer in crystallographic studies using LDAO detergent, the findings demonstrate that detergents can profoundly affect the assembly and functional state of membrane proteins, underscoring the necessity of in vivo assessments to determine their biologically relevant oligomeric forms. The results are significant as they establish the physiologically active form of SaMscL and highlight the impact of solubilization conditions on membrane protein research.
