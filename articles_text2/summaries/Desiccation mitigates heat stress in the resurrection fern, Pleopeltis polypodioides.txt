The study evaluates how desiccation mitigates heat stress in the resurrection fern, **Pleopeltis polypodioides**, by examining the effects of heat on both hydrated and dehydrated fronds. The research found that dried fronds can tolerate temperatures up to 55°C while hydrated fronds only withstand up to 40°C before experiencing significant stress, as indicated by changes in morphology, photosynthetic efficiency, and biochemical responses such as oxidative stress markers and enzyme activity. Ultimately, the ability to withstand heat is largely enhanced by desiccation, suggesting that dehydration serves as a protective mechanism against heat damage in these plants.
