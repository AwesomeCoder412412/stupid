The study focuses on the development and application of the single-image normalized difference vegetation index (SI-NDVI) for early detection of plant stress. This innovative imaging system effectively uses spectral reflectance patterns, specifically comparing leaf reflectance in blue and near-infrared light, allowing researchers to identify stress in plants like *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Eruca sativa* significantly quicker than traditional methods. The SI-NDVI technique is noted for its cost-effectiveness and ease of use, making it suitable for monitoring plant health in controlled environments, thus enhancing indoor farming practices.
