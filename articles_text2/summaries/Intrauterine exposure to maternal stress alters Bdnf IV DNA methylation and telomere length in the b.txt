The study investigates the impact of maternal stress during pregnancy on the brain of adult rat offspring, specifically examining changes in DNA methylation of the Bdnf gene and telomere length. Results show that males exposed to unpredictable prenatal stress had significantly higher levels of Bdnf IV methylation in the medial prefrontal cortex and shorter telomeres compared to control rats, indicating potential long-term effects on brain function and behavior. This research adds to the understanding of how prenatal stress can lead to intergenerational molecular changes linked to behavioral and health outcomes.
