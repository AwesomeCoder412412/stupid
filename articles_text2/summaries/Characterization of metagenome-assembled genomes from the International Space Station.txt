The study characterizes metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the International Space Station (ISS), identifying a total of 46 MAGs, including 20 bacterial and 4 fungal genomes. Significant findings include the discovery of novel species, such as *Kalamiella piersonii* and *Methylobacterium ajmalii*, and phylogenetic evidence indicating that bacterial evolution on the ISS is influenced by microgravity conditions. Additionally, comparative analyses revealed variations in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence genes, suggesting that microbial adaptation strategies may arise in response to the unique environment of space.
