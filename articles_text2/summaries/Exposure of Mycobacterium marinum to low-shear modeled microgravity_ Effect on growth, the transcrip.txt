The study investigates the effects of low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) on the growth, transcriptome, and stress resistance of the waterborne pathogen Mycobacterium marinum. Results indicate that exposure to LSMMG leads to alterations in cell growth, increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, and significant changes in gene expression, suggesting a nutrient-deprived environment that may mimic conditions encountered during infection. Specifically, the sigma factor SigH was found to be a key regulator in the stress response, highlighting potential implications for the survival and virulence of mycobacteria in space conditions.
