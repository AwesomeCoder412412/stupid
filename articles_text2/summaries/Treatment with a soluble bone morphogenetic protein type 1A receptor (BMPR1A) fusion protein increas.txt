Treatment with a soluble Bone Morphogenetic Protein Type 1A receptor (BMPR1A) fusion protein (mBMPR1A-mFc) has been shown to significantly increase bone mass and formation in mice experiencing disuse-induced bone loss through hindlimb unloading. In a study involving adult female mice, the administration of mBMPR1A-mFc resulted in maintained or improved bone density (BMD) and enhanced bone microarchitecture, even in the presence of skeletal unloading. These findings suggest that mBMPR1A-mFc could be a promising therapeutic approach for preventing skeletal deterioration during periods of disuse, by promoting bone formation and reducing resorption.
